### [1] [SaraCoder: Orchestrating Semantic and Structural Cues for Profit-Oriented Repository-Level Code Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10068)
*Xiaohan Chen,Zhongying Pan,Quan Feng,Yu Tian,Shuqun Yang,Mengru Wang,Lina Gong,Yuxia Geng,Piji Li,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Saracoder, a hierarchical retrieval framework that goes beyond simple text similarity for code completion by leveraging deep semantics, structural analysis, and identifier disambiguation, resulting in superior performance over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing repository-level code completion using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) suffers from problems such as semantic misguidance, redundancy, homogeneity, and inability to resolve external symbol ambiguity. Superficial text similarity is inadequate for effective retrieval.

Method: Saracoder is introduced—a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. It employs a Hierarchical Feature Optimization module to distill deep semantic relationships, remove duplicates, assess structural similarity using a novel graph-based metric, and rerank results for relevance/diversity. An External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.

Result: Extensive experiments on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks show that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing baselines across programming languages and models.

Conclusion: Systematic refinement of retrieval results through multiple dimensions (semantic, structural, and cross-file analysis) establishes a new paradigm for accurate and robust repository-level code completion.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

### [2] [FormalGrad: Integrating Formal Methods with Gradient-Based LLM Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10059)
*Yueke Zhang,Yifan Zhang,Kevin Leach,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FormalGrad combines formal methods with LLMs in code generation, resulting in more correct and robust code; it significantly outperforms current methods on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate code with high creativity but often lack guarantees regarding correctness, robustness, and efficiency, especially for tasks with strict constraints.

Method: The paper proposes FormalGrad, a framework that integrates formal methods into an iterative LLM-based code generation loop. It treats code as a differentiable variable and converts formal constraints into a textual pseudo-gradient that guides LLMs to refine the generated code iteratively.

Result: FormalGrad shows substantial performance gains on benchmarks: up to 27% absolute improvement on HumanEval and 41% relative improvement on LiveCodeBench V6 compared to baselines. The generated code is both robust and formally justified.

Conclusion: FormalGrad enables LLMs to produce code that is not only functional but also meets formal correctness and robustness requirements, making it suitable for reliable AI-assisted software development in critical domains.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in code generation, they often produce solutions that lack guarantees of
correctness, robustness, and efficiency. The limitation is acute in domains
requiring strict constraints. FormalGrad introduces a principled framework that
integrates formal methods directly into an iterative LLM-based generation loop.
It uniquely treats code as a differentiable variable, converting structured
feedback and formal constraints into a textual pseudo-gradient. This gradient
guides the model to iteratively refine solutions, ensuring they are not only
functional but also robust and formally justified. We evaluate FormalGrad on
the HumanEval, HumanEval+, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. Our implementation
outperforms strong baselines, achieving an absolute improvement of up to 27% on
HumanEval and a 41% relative improvement on the challenging LiveCodeBench V6.
FormalGrad generates formally justified code that is robust and efficient,
paving the way for reliable AI-assisted software development in high-stakes
applications.

### [3] [Next Edit Prediction: Learning to Predict Code Edits from Context and Interaction History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10074)
*Ruofan Lu,Yintong Huo,Meng Zhang,Yichen Li,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Current code assistants are limited by reactive paradigms. This paper proposes 'Next Edit Prediction'—a proactive model that anticipates developers' edits. Using a curated dataset and extensive evaluation, their models outperform baselines, paving the way for smarter, seamless code assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-powered coding assistants either offer code completion suggestions constrained to the cursor (low-latency) or allow chat-based editing that requires developers to articulate their intent, causing disruptive context-switching. Neither approach proactively anticipates the developer's next move, which impacts user experience.

Method: The authors introduce the 'Next Edit Prediction' task, which predicts both the location and content of the developer's next code edit based on recent interaction history. They curate a supervised fine-tuning dataset and evaluation benchmark for this task, then fine-tune several models and compare the results to baseline models.

Result: Fine-tuned models on the Next Edit Prediction task outperform baseline models in predicting developer edits, yielding new insights into intent inference and proactive assistant behavior.

Conclusion: This research establishes Next Edit Prediction as a foundational task that enables coding assistants to anticipate developer actions, creating a seamless and collaborative interaction paradigm that's superior to merely responsive tools.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a
development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers
completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current
position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex
modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in
natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This
creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts
the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap
and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next
Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent
interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent
edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct
supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive
evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding
several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction
paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their
following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

### [4] [On the synchronization between Hugging Face pre-trained language models and their upstream GitHub repository](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10157)
*Ajibode Adekunle,Abdul Ali Bangash,Bram Adams,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Pretrained language model development is fragmented across GitHub and Hugging Face, often lacking proper synchronization in updates and releases. This study found prevalent patterns of partial and poor synchronization, threatening model quality and user safety. Better coordination is needed for reliable PTLM releases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained language models (PTLMs) have become integral to NLP, but their development and distribution spans across upstream repositories (like GitHub) and downstream platforms (like Hugging Face). Managing releases, versioning, and reuse across these sites is challenging, leading to potential fragmentation and inconsistency.

Method: A mixed-method study was conducted, examining 325 PTLM families and 904 Hugging Face variants. The study analyzed commit activities in both GitHub and Hugging Face, investigating differences in contribution focus and synchronization patterns across three dimensions: lag (delay), type of synchronization, and intensity.

Result: GitHub contributors mostly focused on technical aspects like versioning, code quality, performance, and dependencies, while Hugging Face contributors focused on documentation, dataset handling, and inference setup. The synchronization analysis identified eight distinct patterns, with a prevalence of partially synchronized (disperse and sparse) patterns, highlighting structural disconnects and fragmentation in release practices.

Conclusion: The lack of synchronization between GitHub and Hugging Face leads to isolated or abandoned repositories, risking incomplete or inconsistent models for users. Recognizing and addressing these synchronization patterns is crucial for better traceability, oversight, and reliability in PTLM workflows.

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PTLMs) have advanced natural language processing
(NLP), enabling progress in tasks like text generation and translation. Like
software package management, PTLMs are trained using code and environment
scripts in upstream repositories (e.g., GitHub, GH) and distributed as variants
via downstream platforms like Hugging Face (HF). Coordinating development
between GH and HF poses challenges such as misaligned release timelines,
inconsistent versioning, and limited reuse of PTLM variants. We conducted a
mixed-method study of 325 PTLM families (904 HF variants) to examine how commit
activities are coordinated. Our analysis reveals that GH contributors typically
make changes related to specifying the version of the model, improving code
quality, performance optimization, and dependency management within the
training scripts, while HF contributors make changes related to improving model
descriptions, data set handling, and setup required for model inference.
Furthermore, to understand the synchronization aspects of commit activities
between GH and HF, we examined three dimensions of these activities -- lag
(delay), type of synchronization, and intensity -- which together yielded eight
distinct synchronization patterns. The prevalence of partially synchronized
patterns, such as Disperse synchronization and Sparse synchronization, reveals
structural disconnects in current cross-platform release practices. These
patterns often result in isolated changes -- where improvements or fixes made
on one platform are never replicated on the other -- and in some cases,
indicate an abandonment of one repository in favor of the other. Such
fragmentation risks exposing end users to incomplete, outdated, or behaviorally
inconsistent models. Hence, recognizing these synchronization patterns is
critical for improving oversight and traceability in PTLM release workflows.

### [5] [Bridging Solidity Evolution Gaps: An LLM-Enhanced Approach for Smart Contract Compilation Error Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10517)
*Likai Ye,Mengliang Li,Dehai Zhao,Jiamou Sun,Xiaoxue Ren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Frequent Solidity updates cause serious migration and compilation issues for smart contracts. While LLMs help, their performance is limited. The new SMCFIXER framework, combining expert guidance and LLMs, markedly improves error resolution and achieves nearly perfect accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges caused by rapid evolution and frequent updates in the Solidity language, leading to significant issues with compilation errors, code migration, and maintenance for Ethereum smart contracts.

Method: The method involves an empirical study quantifying the prevalence of compilation errors due to Solidity version changes and evaluating the capability of large language models (LLMs) to resolve these errors. The paper then proposes SMCFIXER, a framework that combines expert knowledge retrieval and LLMs in three phases: code slicing, expert knowledge retrieval, and iterative patch generation, to improve Solidity migration.

Result: The study finds that over 81% of contracts encounter errors when compiled with different Solidity versions, and current LLMs struggle with semantic error repair and are sensitive to prompt engineering. The proposed SMCFIXER framework, however, delivers a 24.24% improvement over GPT-4o and achieves 96.97% accuracy in resolving migration-related compilation errors.

Conclusion: Solidity's rapid evolution poses real obstacles for developers, but integrating expert knowledge with LLM-based repair significantly improves error resolution. SMCFIXER demonstrates near-perfect accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, highlighting the value of domain-specific approaches in smart contract maintenance and migration.

Abstract: Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly
evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and
developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant
challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and
maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the
challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined
contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92%
of compilation errors.
  To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large
language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version
migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek)
and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these
models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes
significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt
engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific
adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.
  Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that
systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair
mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture
comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts
relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official
documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.
Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our
approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on
real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.

### [6] [EVOSCAT: Exploring Software Change Dynamics in Large-Scale Historical Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10852)
*Souhaila Serbout,Diana Carolina Muñoz Hurtado,Hassan Atwi,Edoardo Riggio,Cesare Pautasso*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoScat, a tool that enables interactive and scalable visualizations of large software evolution datasets by using density scatterplots. It allows researchers to analyze and compare the histories of many artifacts efficiently and flexibly, supporting advanced empirical analysis of how open source software evolves over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical software engineering researchers face challenges in visualizing and analyzing massive historical datasets resulting from the evolution of long-lived software projects. Traditional visualization tools often cannot scale to the large number of artifacts and revisions present in these datasets.

Method: The paper proposes EvoScat, a tool that uses interactive density scatterplots to visualize large historical datasets from open source software repositories. EvoScat provides options for scaling and aligning artifact histories along the time axis, sorting artifacts, and applying interactive color mapping. The tool is highly configurable to suit different analysis needs such as pace of change, clone detection, and dataset freshness.

Result: EvoScat enables scalable visualization and analysis of millions of historical change events from tens of thousands of software artifacts. The paper demonstrates its application through a gallery of datasets, including specific artifact types (OpenAPI descriptions, GitHub workflow definitions) and in-depth explorations of histories from well-known open source projects.

Conclusion: EvoScat addresses the temporal scalability challenge in empirical software engineering by empowering researchers with interactive, customizable visualizations. This aids in understanding and comparing the evolution of software artifacts across large datasets, supporting more effective empirical studies.

Abstract: Long lived software projects encompass a large number of artifacts, which
undergo many revisions throughout their history. Empirical software engineering
researchers studying software evolution gather and collect datasets with
millions of events, representing changes introduced to specific artifacts. In
this paper, we propose EvoScat, a tool that attempts addressing temporal
scalability through the usage of interactive density scatterplot to provide a
global overview of large historical datasets mined from open source
repositories in a single visualization. EvoScat intents to provide researchers
with a mean to produce scalable visualizations that can help them explore and
characterize evolution datasets, as well as comparing the histories of
individual artifacts, both in terms of 1) observing how rapidly different
artifacts age over multiple-year-long time spans 2) how often metrics
associated with each artifacts tend towards an improvement or worsening. The
paper shows how the tool can be tailored to specific analysis needs (pace of
change comparison, clone detection, freshness assessment) thanks to its support
for flexible configuration of history scaling and alignment along the time
axis, artifacts sorting and interactive color mapping, enabling the analysis of
millions of events obtained by mining the histories of tens of thousands of
software artifacts. We include in this paper a gallery showcasing datasets
gathering specific artifacts (OpenAPI descriptions, GitHub workflow
definitions) across multiple repositories, as well as diving into the history
of specific popular open source projects.

### [7] [Generating Compilers for Qubit Mapping and Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10781)
*Abtin Molavi,Amanda Xu,Ethan Cecchetti,Swamit Tannu,Aws Albarghouthi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generic framework and language (Marol) for automatically generating quantum circuit mapping and routing compilers for arbitrary architectures, showing competitive performance to manual solutions and promising faster, easier compiler development as quantum hardware diversifies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum architectures are rapidly evolving and diverse, presenting significant challenges for efficiently mapping and routing qubits in quantum circuits. Existing solutions are typically specialized for particular hardware and constraints, requiring extensive manual effort.

Method: The authors developed an abstract QMR (qubit mapping and routing) problem formulation using a device state machine, enabling generalization across architectures. This led to the creation of Marol, a domain-specific language for defining QMR problems, and a parametric solver that automatically generates compilers based on Marol specifications.

Result: Case studies across various quantum architectures (both noisy and fault-tolerant, from all major hardware platforms) demonstrate that automatically generated compilers using this approach match or exceed the performance of manually written special-purpose compilers in terms of runtime and solution quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and Marol DSL significantly reduce the effort required to develop quantum compilers for new, diverse architectures, aiding future quantum computing compiler development as hardware evolves.

Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than classical
computers, potentially unlocking breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry,
and beyond. Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they
minimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation
step is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit
qubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while
satisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the
landscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.
Given this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for
different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error
correction schemes.
  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing
compilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is
different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use
to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a
domain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the
well-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.
We demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a
powerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We
evaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior
and recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all
major hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated
compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of
runtime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify
development of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue
to emerge.
