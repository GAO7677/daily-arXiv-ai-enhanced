### [1] [Generating Highly Structured Test Inputs Leveraging Constraint-Guided Graph Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21271)
*Zhaorui Yang,Yuxin Qiu,Haichao Zhu,Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GRAphRef is a graph-based framework for generating structurally-valid test inputs for AI systems, outperforming traditional methods by being more general and effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI frequently handles highly structured data like 3D meshes, but existing fuzzing/input generation tools are ad-hoc, type-specific, and often inefficient, producing a lot of invalid test cases. There is a need for a more generalized, efficient, and structurally-aware input generation approach.

Method: The authors develop GRAphRef, a framework mapping structured data to graphs for test input generation. GRAphRef uses neighbor-similarity-guided mutations and a constraint-refinement mechanism to ensure generated inputs preserve structural and semantic validity. It is evaluated on eight real-world mesh-processing AI systems, against AFL, MeshAttack, Saffron, and ablated variants, with metrics including validity, semantic preservation, and overhead.

Result: GRAphRef increases the structural validity and semantic preservation of generated test inputs compared to alternative methods. The evaluation, using mesh data and outputs from several AI models, shows GRAphRef to be more generalizable and efficient. Statistical and performance breakdowns substantiate these findings.

Conclusion: A graph-based approach, as realized by GRAphRef, provides a practical, generalized solution for structurally-valid test input generation in AI systems handling complex data types, outperforming specialized and less structurally-aware tools.

Abstract: [Context] Modern AI applications increasingly process highly structured data,
such as 3D meshes and point clouds, where test input generation must preserve
both structural and semantic validity. However, existing fuzzing tools and
input generators are typically handcrafted for specific input types and often
generate invalid inputs that are subsequently discarded, leading to
inefficiency and poor generalizability. [Objective] This study investigates
whether test inputs for structured domains can be unified through a graph-based
representation, enabling general, reusable mutation strategies while enforcing
structural constraints. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in
enhancing input validity and semantic preservation across eight AI systems.
[Method] We develop and evaluate GRAphRef, a graph-based test input generation
framework that supports constraint-based mutation and refinement. GRAphRef maps
structured inputs to graphs, applies neighbor-similarity-guided mutations, and
uses a constraint-refinement phase to repair invalid inputs. We will conduct a
confirmatory study across eight real-world mesh-processing AI systems,
comparing GRAphRef with AFL, MeshAttack, Saffron, and two ablated variants.
Evaluation metrics include structural validity, semantic preservation (via
prediction consistency), and performance overhead. Experimental data is derived
from ShapeNetCore mesh seeds and model outputs from systems like MeshCNN and
HodgeNet. Statistical analysis and component latency breakdowns will be used to
assess each hypothesis.

### [2] ["Maybe We Need Some More Examples:" Individual and Team Drivers of Developer GenAI Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21280)
*Courtney Miller,Rudrajit Choudhuri,Mara Ulloa,Sankeerti Haniyur,Robert DeLine,Margaret-Anne Storey,Emerson Murphy-Hill,Christian Bird,Jenna L. Butler*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Developer adoption of generative AI tools varies mainly due to differences in perception, engagement style, and response to difficulties. Pushing for quick productivity improvements without proper learning support can backfire, ultimately decreasing the expected benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI tools are widely accessible in software engineering, but their adoption by developers is inconsistent. This inconsistency causes issues with productivity, managerial expectations, and uncertainty about developers' roles.

Method: The study conducted paired interviews with 54 developers (one frequent user and one infrequent user from each of 27 teams) to understand the reasons behind differences in tool usage.

Result: The study found that adoption differences are driven by how developers perceive the AI tool (collaborator vs. feature), their engagement styles (experimental vs. conservative), and their responses to challenges (persistent vs. quick to give up).

Conclusion: Expecting rapid productivity gains from generative AI tools without enough investment in learning support leads to the 'Productivity Pressure Paradox,' which reduces the productivity improvements these tools are meant to provide.

Abstract: Despite the widespread availability of generative AI tools in software
engineering, developer adoption remains uneven. This unevenness is problematic
because it hampers productivity efforts, frustrates management's expectations,
and creates uncertainty around the future roles of developers. Through paired
interviews with 54 developers across 27 teams -- one frequent and one
infrequent user per team -- we demonstrate that differences in usage result
primarily from how developers perceive the tool (as a collaborator vs.
feature), their engagement approach (experimental vs. conservative), and how
they respond when encountering challenges (with adaptive persistence vs. quick
abandonment). Our findings imply that widespread organizational expectations
for rapid productivity gains without sufficient investment in learning support
creates a "Productivity Pressure Paradox," undermining the very productivity
benefits that motivate adoption.

### [3] [Black-Box Bug-Amplification for Multithreaded Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21318)
*Yeshayahu Weiss,Gal Amram,Achiya Elyasaf,Eitan Farchi,Oded Margalit,Gera Weiss*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel, model-based testing approach to increase the likelihood of reproducing rare concurrency bugs, showing that regression models dramatically outperform random sampling in exposing hidden faults without changing the system's internal architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bugs in concurrent systems are hard to reproduce because they appear only under rare conditions, posing challenges for testers to consistently expose and diagnose such rare failures.

Method: The authors treat the system as a black-box, using repeated executions under varied input configurations. They then train a predictive model to estimate the probability of an input configuration triggering a bug. Different model-based search strategies are compared to brute-force random sampling for bug amplification.

Result: The study demonstrates that ensemble regression models can markedly improve the rate of discovering elusive bugs, outperforming random sampling techniques by orders of magnitude across most evaluated scenarios.

Conclusion: Model-guided, black-box testing significantly amplifies the manifestation of concurrent bugs and provides practical means for testers to uncover hidden faults, without requiring invasive modifications of the system.

Abstract: Bugs, especially those in concurrent systems, are often hard to reproduce
because they manifest only under rare conditions. Testers frequently encounter
failures that occur only under specific inputs, even when occurring with low
probability. We propose an approach to systematically amplify the occurrence of
such elusive bugs. We treat the system under test as a black-box and use
repeated trial executions to train a predictive model that estimates the
probability of a given input configuration triggering a bug. We evaluate this
approach on a dataset of 17 representative concurrency bugs spanning diverse
categories. Several model-based search techniques are compared against a
brute-force random sampling baseline. Our results show that an ensemble of
regression models can significantly increase bug occurrence rates across nearly
all scenarios, often achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement over random
sampling. The contributions of this work include: (i) a novel formulation of
bug-amplification as a rare-event regression problem; (ii) an empirical
evaluation of multiple techniques for amplifying bug occurrence, demonstrating
the effectiveness of model-guided search; and (iii) a practical, non-invasive
testing framework that helps practitioners expose hidden concurrency faults
without altering the internal system architecture.

### [4] [Does Editing Improve Answer Quality on Stack Overflow? A Data-Driven Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21329)
*Saikat Mondal,Chanchal K. Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Accepted edits on Stack Overflow Python answers do not always improve qualityâ€”in many cases, they decrease readability, increase security risks, and break working code, suggesting that collaborative editing needs stricter quality controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Technical Q&A platforms like Stack Overflow are vital to software development, but poor-quality answers can create bugs, security issues, and technical debt. While collaborative editing is intended to improve answer quality, it is unclear whether accepted edits truly enhance important quality aspects. Previous studies focused on edit rejection or narrow aspects (like C/C++ vulnerabilities), leaving a gap in comprehensive quality assessment, especially in popular tags like Python.

Method: The authors systematically analyzed 94,994 Python-related Stack Overflow answers that have at least one accepted edit. They evaluated the impact of edits across six key quality dimensions: semantic relevance, code usability, code complexity, security vulnerabilities, code optimization, and readability.

Result: Results reveal mixed outcomes from accepted edits: 53.3% of edits improved answer-question relevance, while 38.1% made them less relevant. Edits rendered 9% of previously broken code executable, but broke 14.7% of working code. Edits often increased code complexity (32.3%) and introduced new security issues in 20.5% of cases. Though 51% improved performance, overall execution time increased. Notably, 49.7% of edits reduced code readability.

Conclusion: Accepted edits do not consistently improve answer quality; instead, they often introduce new issues, negatively affecting maintainability, security, and usability. The study highlights inconsistencies in collaborative editing outcomes and underscores the need for better mechanisms to guide and monitor edits on technical Q&A platforms.

Abstract: High-quality answers in technical Q&A platforms like Stack Overflow (SO) are
crucial as they directly influence software development practices. Poor-quality
answers can introduce inefficiencies, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, and
thus increase maintenance costs and technical debt in production software. To
improve content quality, SO allows collaborative editing, where users revise
answers to enhance clarity, correctness, and formatting. Several studies have
examined rejected edits and identified the causes of rejection. However, prior
research has not systematically assessed whether accepted edits enhance key
quality dimensions. While one study investigated the impact of edits on C/C++
vulnerabilities, broader quality aspects remain unexplored. In this study, we
analyze 94,994 Python-related answers that have at least one accepted edit to
determine whether edits improve (1) semantic relevance, (2) code usability, (3)
code complexity, (4) security vulnerabilities, (5) code optimization, and (6)
readability. Our findings show both positive and negative effects of edits.
While 53.3% of edits improve how well answers match questions, 38.1% make them
less relevant. Some previously broken code (9%) becomes executable, yet working
code (14.7%) turns non-parsable after edits. Many edits increase complexity
(32.3%), making code harder to maintain. Instead of fixing security issues,
20.5% of edits introduce additional issues. Even though 51.0% of edits optimize
performance, execution time still increases overall. Readability also suffers,
as 49.7% of edits make code harder to read. This study highlights the
inconsistencies in editing outcomes and provides insights into how edits impact
software maintainability, security, and efficiency that might caution users and
moderators and help future improvements in collaborative editing systems.

### [5] [MAAD: Automate Software Architecture Design through Knowledge-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21382)
*Ruiyin Li,Yiran Zhang,Xiyu Zhou,Peng Liang,Weisong Sun,Jifeng Xuan,Zhi Jin,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MAAD is a multi-agent framework leveraging LLMs to automate and enhance software architecture design; it surpasses a strong baseline and gains industry approval, with GPT-4o providing the best results among tested LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software architecture design is critical but complex, requiring deep expertise and often resulting in limited design alternatives under agile development pressures. There is a need to make this process more efficient and to explore how Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents can support architecture design, an area with limited prior research.

Method: The authors proposed MAAD, a knowledge-driven Multi-Agent Architecture Design framework, where four specialized agents (Analyst, Modeler, Designer, Evaluator) collaborate to analyze requirements and generate architectural blueprints with quality evaluation reports. MAAD was evaluated through case studies, comparative experiments against MetaGPT, and feedback from industrial architects.

Result: MAAD outperformed MetaGPT by producing more comprehensive architectural components and more structured, insightful evaluation reports. Industrial architects found MAAD practically usable in real scenarios. Additionally, among various LLMs used in MAAD, GPT-4o performed best, highlighting the significance of LLM choice in MAS-driven architecture design.

Conclusion: MAAD demonstrates the advantages of a multi-agent, LLM-driven approach to automating software architecture design, outperforming existing baselines and receiving positive feedback from practitioners. The framework's effectiveness also depends on selecting powerful LLMs like GPT-4o.

Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and
knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain
expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs
among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving
requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited
design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across
various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively
scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain
knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed
MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a
knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD
orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and
Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce
architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation
reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative
experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show
that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural
components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation
reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements
specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally
explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance
in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection
in MAS-driven architecture design.

### [6] [LLM4VV: Evaluating Cutting-Edge LLMs for Generation and Evaluation of Directive-Based Parallel Programming Model Compiler Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21447)
*Zachariah Sollenberger,Rahul Patel,Saieda Ali Zada,Sunita Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes and evaluates a dual-LLM framework for generating and automatically verifying compiler tests. By leveraging generative and discriminative LLMs, the authors show that quality, trustworthy compiler test generation is achievable, demonstrating the promising potential of LLMs for reliable software engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development, and the need to address concerns surrounding the correctness of code generated by LLMs. Issues like hallucinations (incorrect outputs) and lack of logical explainability hinder trust and widespread adoption.

Method: The paper proposes a dual-LLM system, utilizing both a generative LLM and a discriminative LLM, to generate and verify a large volume of compiler tests. The approach is evaluated using several LLMs with different parameter sizes and assessed across ten carefully-selected metrics.

Result: The experimental results show that LLMs have significant potential not only to generate quality compiler tests but also to automatically verify them, when used in the proposed dual-LLM framework.

Conclusion: LLMs, when properly guided and verified using a dual-LLM system, can effectively contribute to the generation and autonomous verification of compiler tests, addressing key challenges such as hallucinations and lack of trust in automated code generation.

Abstract: The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development
has continued to increase since LLMs were first introduced, but only recently
have the expectations of LLMs become more realistic. Verifying the correctness
of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have
been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet.
Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems
without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to
explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their
results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply
LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a
discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation
of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs
possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten
carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through
our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to
generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.

### [7] [HLSDebugger: Identification and Correction of Logic Bugs in HLS Code with LLM Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21485)
*Jing Wang,Shang Liu,Yao Lu,Zhiyao Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: HLSDebugger is a new automated tool that uses a large dataset and an encoder-decoder model to identify and correct HLS code bugs more effectively than existing large language models like GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debugging HLS code is time-consuming and difficult, particularly for individuals without deep hardware expertise. The complexity of hardware bugs and lack of training data exacerbate the difficulty, while recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to automate and improve the HLS debugging process.

Method: The authors present HLSDebugger, a customized model based on an encoder-decoder architecture designed to automate HLS logic debugging. HLSDebugger is trained on a newly created dataset of 300,000 labeled HLS bug samples. The model is designed to simultaneously perform bug location identification, bug type prediction, and bug correction.

Result: HLSDebugger outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in HLS bug identification and achieves over 3x improvement in bug correction performance. The tool demonstrates significant advances in automated debugging capabilities for HLS code.

Conclusion: HLSDebugger introduces a specialized approach to automated debugging for HLS, leveraging a large, labeled dataset and a multitasking model structure. It significantly advances the field by providing superior bug identification and correction compared to state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the
automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware
implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and
labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software
engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging
process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when
applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training
LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in
hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with
existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires
multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.
complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this
work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the
challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset
with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts
an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type
prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly
outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x
in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of
automated debugging of HLS code.

### [8] [Ethical Classification of Non-Coding Contributions in Open-Source Projects via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21583)
*Sergio Cobos,Javier Luis CÃ¡novas Izquierdo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based framework using the Contributor Covenant for ethically evaluating OSS project interactions, aiming to automate and improve community code of conduct enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open Source Software development faces not only technical challenges but also social and ethical ones due to the diverse backgrounds of contributors and the importance of fostering a collaborative, respectful environment. Existing approaches for monitoring and enforcing ethical participation via codes of conduct are limited and difficult to scale.

Method: The authors propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classifying the ethical quality of non-coding contributions, such as issues and comments, in OSS projects. They developed ethical metrics based on the Contributor Covenant and used prompt engineering to tailor LLM outputs for this classification task.

Result: A classification approach leveraging LLMs was developed to assess ethical behavior in OSS non-coding contributions. The approach evaluates these interactions based on a set of predefined ethical metrics inspired by the Contributor Covenant.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effectively guided through prompt engineering and tailored metrics to classify and assess the ethical quality of non-coding contributions in OSS projects, offering a scalable and automated solution to support positive community behavior.

Abstract: The development of Open-Source Software (OSS) is not only a technical
challenge, but also a social one due to the diverse mixture of contributors. To
this aim, social-coding platforms, such as GitHub, provide the infrastructure
needed to host and develop the code, but also the support for enabling the
community's collaboration, which is driven by non-coding contributions, such as
issues (i.e., change proposals or bug reports) or comments to existing
contributions. As with any other social endeavor, this development process
faces ethical challenges, which may put at risk the project's sustainability.
To foster a productive and positive environment, OSS projects are increasingly
deploying codes of conduct, which define rules to ensure a respectful and
inclusive participatory environment, with the Contributor Covenant being the
main model to follow. However, monitoring and enforcing these codes of conduct
is a challenging task, due to the limitations of current approaches. In this
paper, we propose an approach to classify the ethical quality of non-coding
contributions in OSS projects by relying on Large Language Models (LLM), a
promising technology for text classification tasks. We defined a set of ethical
metrics based on the Contributor Covenant and developed a classification
approach to assess ethical behavior in OSS non-coding contributions, using
prompt engineering to guide the model's output.

### [9] [Predicting Maintenance Cessation of Open Source Software Repositories with An Integrated Feature Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21678)
*Yiming Xu,Runzhi He,Hengzhi Ye,Minghui Zhou,Huaimin Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The authors present a new, interpretable approach for predicting when OSS projects will stop being maintained, using advanced features and a large GitHub dataset. Their model outperforms previous methods and has been validated in real-world ecosystem risk screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open source software (OSS) projects face significant maintenance risks, threatening software supply chains, yet current prediction methods for these risks are often ambiguous, hard to interpret, or not generalizable.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of 'maintenance cessation,' linking explicit archival status with semantic analysis of documentation. A large longitudinal GitHub dataset (115,466 repositories) is analyzed. An integrated framework using user-, maintainer-, and project evolution-centric features is developed. AFT survival analysis and SHAP are used to evaluate prediction models, and a GBSA classifier is deployed in the openEuler ecosystem.

Result: Their model achieves a high C-index (0.846), significantly outperforming models based only on surface features. Feature ablation and SHAP confirm both effectiveness and interpretability. The framework is shown to be effective in a real-world OSS risk screening application.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable and interpretable method for predicting maintenance cessation (risk) in OSS, establishing a reproducible foundation for large-scale risk management.

Abstract: The maintenance risks of open source software (OSS) projects pose significant
threats to the quality, security, and resilience of modern software supply
chains. While prior research has proposed diverse approaches for predicting OSS
maintenance risk -- leveraging signals ranging from surface features (e.g.,
stars, commits) to social network analyses and behavioral patterns -- existing
methods often suffer from ambiguous operational definitions, limited
interpretability, and datasets of insufficient scale or generalizability. In
this work, we introduce ``maintenance cessation'', grounded in both explicit
archival status and rigorous semantic analysis of project documentation.
Building on this foundation, we curate a large-scale, longitudinal dataset of
115,466 GitHub repositories -- encompassing 57,733 confirmed cessation events
-- complemented by comprehensive, timeline-based behavioral features. We
propose an integrated, multi-perspective feature framework for predicting
maintenance cessation, systematically combining user-centric features,
maintainer-centric features and project evolution features. AFT survival
analysis demonstrates a high C-index (0.846), substantially outperforming
models relying only on surface features. Feature ablation and SHAP analysis
further confirm the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach.
Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by deploying a GBSA classifier
in the openEuler ecosystem for proactive package risk screening. Our work
establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for maintenance-risk
prediction, enabling reproducible risk management across large-scale open
source ecosystems.

### [10] [MultiAIGCD: A Comprehensive dataset for AI Generated Code Detection Covering Multiple Languages, Models,Prompts, and Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21693)
*Basak Demirok,Mucahid Kutlu,Selin Mergen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiAIGCD, a major new dataset for detecting AI-generated code in Python, Java, and Go, featuring various generation scenarios. The authors benchmark leading detection models and release their resources to advance research in this increasingly critical field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate useful code, legitimate concerns have arisen regarding their impact on education and job recruitment, with the need for reliable detection systems to ensure fairness and academic integrity.

Method: The authors created MultiAIGCD, a large dataset for AI-generated code detection in Python, Java, and Go, using CodeNet problem definitions, human-authored codes, and code samples generated from six LLMs with three prompts under various scenarios. They benchmarked three detection models on this dataset across tasks, including cross-model and cross-language testing.

Result: They produced a dataset of over 121,000 AI-generated and 32,000 human-written code snippets, and evaluated the detection ability of state-of-the-art systems in multiple scenarios. The dataset and code are publicly shared for further research.

Conclusion: MultiAIGCD is a valuable new resource that enables systematic evaluation of AI-generated code detection methods, facilitating advances in maintaining academic and professional integrity as code generation by LLMs grows.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, their role in code
generation has expanded significantly. While this offers streamlined
development, it also creates concerns in areas like education and job
interviews. Consequently, developing robust systems to detect AI-generated code
is imperative to maintain academic integrity and ensure fairness in hiring
processes. In this study, we introduce MultiAIGCD, a dataset for AI-generated
code detection for Python, Java, and Go. From the CodeNet dataset's problem
definitions and human-authored codes, we generate several code samples in Java,
Python, and Go with six different LLMs and three different prompts. This
generation process covered three key usage scenarios: (i) generating code from
problem descriptions, (ii) fixing runtime errors in human-written code, and
(iii) correcting incorrect outputs. Overall, MultiAIGCD consists of 121,271
AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. We also benchmark three
state-of-the-art AI-generated code detection models and assess their
performance in various test scenarios such as cross-model and cross-language.
We share our dataset and codes to support research in this field.

### [11] [Vibe Coding as a Reconfiguration of Intent Mediation in Software Development: Definition, Implications, and Research Agenda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21928)
*Christian Meske,Tobias Hermanns,Esther von der Weiden,Kai-Uwe Loser,Thorsten Berger*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Vibe coding, where humans and AI co-create software using natural language, is rapidly changing software development. It shifts expertise and responsibilities, introduces both new opportunities and risks, and calls for a comprehensive research agenda to understand its implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the rapid adoption of AI-generated code (vibe coding) in software development, despite limited understanding of its conceptual impact. There is a growing gap between the use of generative AI tools in coding and our theoretical grasp of their influence on software engineering.

Method: The authors use an intent perspective and historical analysis to define and investigate vibe coding. They examine how the mediation of developer intent is altered by collaborative flow between humans and generative AI, and assess how cognitive work and expertise distribution shift in this new paradigm.

Result: Vibe coding shifts epistemic labor from humans to machines and redistributes expertise from traditional domains like design and technical skills toward collaborative orchestration of AI-human interaction. Key opportunities identified are democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, while key risks include black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and bias. The paper offers a research agenda for future study.

Conclusion: Vibe coding fundamentally transforms software development by enabling collaborative creation between humans and AI, which requires a rethinking of intent mediation, expertise, opportunities, risks, and research needs across human, technological, and organizational domains.

Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe
coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now
being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited
conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging
paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define
vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI
engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural
language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from
deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we
refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their
conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.
Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing
epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the
software development process away from traditional areas such as design or
technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key
opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,
alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and
ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,
technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future
investigations of this paradigm.

### [12] [DeepGo: Predictive Directed Greybox Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21952)
*Peihong Lin,Pengfei Wang,Xu Zhou,Wei Xie,Gen Zhang,Kai Lu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DeepGo is a novel fuzzer that uses reinforcement learning and deep learning to predict and guide optimal paths to complex software targets, surpassing traditional fuzzing methods that rely only on past execution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Directed Grey-box Fuzzing (DGF) techniques optimize the fitness metric using heuristic algorithms. These heuristics often rely only on historical execution paths, lacking the ability to efficiently anticipate or explore paths that have not yet been executed, especially those with complex constraints. This limits the efficiency of DGF in reaching hard-to-execute target sites.

Method: The authors introduce DeepGo, a predictive DGF that integrates both historical and predicted information using machine learning. They propose a path transition model to frame DGF as navigating through path transition sequences toward a target. A deep neural network-based Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE) is used to imitate and predict rewards for both tried and untried path transitions. Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) is developed to generate optimal path transition sequences, combining past and forecast transitions and guiding mutation strategies using a policy. The concept of an action group is also proposed to optimize these mutation strategies for higher efficiency.

Result: DeepGo can identify and exercise optimal paths to reach complex target sites more efficiently by leveraging both predicted and historical path transition information. The approach comprehensively improves DGF by predicting high-reward (effective) transitions, determining the best mutation strategies, and optimizing the overall fuzzing process.

Conclusion: Combining reinforcement learning and deep neural networks with DGF provides a significant advancement in guiding fuzzers toward complex targets. By modeling path transitions and their rewards, DeepGo overcomes the deficiencies of heuristic-only approaches, making fuzzing more effective at reaching hard-to-execute paths.

Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric
to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for
fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been
exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would
hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,
we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine
historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via
an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF
as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,
and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence
indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to
predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually
imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions
that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a
Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine
historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path
transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of
fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we
propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the
critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target
efficiently.

### [13] [Fine-Tuning Code Language Models to Detect Cross-Language Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21954)

TL;DR: Detecting cross-language bugs in multilingual programming projects requires fine-tuning code models on specific datasets, as single-language bug detection methods are ineffective. Model size, dataset size, and code comments all impact performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual programming is increasingly prevalent because of its benefits, but it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs) that are hard to detect with standard single-language bug detection tools.

Method: The authors developed CLCFinder, a cross-language bug identification tool, and built a CLB dataset across three programming language combinations with nine interaction types. They fine-tuned 13 pre-trained code language models (CodeLMs) on this dataset and evaluated their CLB detection ability, examining the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and code comments.

Result: Pre-trained CodeLMs performed poorly on CLB detection before fine-tuning, but improved after fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Smaller fine-tuned models generally outperformed larger ones. Models fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets were ineffective for CLB detection. Larger fine-tuning datasets significantly improved performance, but longer code token sequences did not always help. Code comments had mixed effects, sometimes improving and sometimes degrading performance.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning code language models on targeted CLB datasets is essential for effective cross-language bug detection. Single-language bug detection models do not generalize to CLBs. Model size, dataset size, code token sequence length, and code comments all influence detection performance in nuanced ways.

Abstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages
(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,
it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between
different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection
tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language
models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language
code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL
combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction
types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their
performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and
code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before
fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after
fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,
small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs
fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,
demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.
Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved
performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model
performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned
CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.

### [14] [One Weird Trick to Untie Landin's Knot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21317)
*Paulette Koronkevich,William J. Bowman*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Adding higher-order references to terminating languages does not, by itself, enable recursion and non-termination. The real culprit is unrestricted quantification over function environments, which, together with references, enables recursion. Restricting this quantification may allow safe use of higher-order references without complex type systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the conditions under which general recursion, and thus non-termination, can be introduced into otherwise terminating languages by extending them with higher-order references. In particular, the paper investigates whether higher-order references alone are sufficient for this or if additional features are required.

Method: The authors approach this by examining Landin's Knot, a classic technique for encoding recursion, in the context of a closure-converted language. They analyze the role of impredicative quantification in the environment of functions and demonstrate how this quantification enables recursion when references are present.

Result: The main result is that higher-order references alone do not always enable non-termination. It is the combination of references and impredicative quantification over function environments that allows for recursion as encoded by Landin's Knot. The authors further conjecture that by restricting environment quantification, it might be possible to safely add higher-order references to terminating languages without more complex type systems or restrictions.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the risk of introducing general recursion with higher-order references depends critically on the use of unrestricted quantification over environments, not merely on references storing functions. Therefore, controlling quantification might be a more precise and less restrictive way to maintain termination properties in languages extended with higher-order references.

Abstract: In this work, we explore Landin's Knot, which is understood as a pattern for
encoding general recursion, including non-termination, that is possible after
adding higher-order references to an otherwise terminating language. We observe
that this isn't always true -- higher-order references, by themselves, don't
lead to non-termination. The key insight is that Landin's Knot relies not
primarily on references storing functions, but on unrestricted quantification
over a function's environment. We show this through a closure converted
language, in which the function's environment is made explicit and hides the
type of the environment through impredicative quantification. Once references
are added, this impredicative quantification can be exploited to encode
recursion. We conjecture that by restricting the quantification over the
environment, higher-order references can be safely added to terminating
languages, without resorting to more complex type systems such as linearity,
and without restricting references from storing functions.

### [15] [Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming: A Concise and Elegant Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21439)
*Yong Qi Foo,Brian Sze-Kai Cheong,Michael D. Adams*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: FPOP is a new programming paradigm that makes fixed-point computations easy and concise, reducing code size and complexity, improving maintainability, and enabling rapid prototyping for problems like graph algorithms and static analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many computational problems, such as graph algorithms and static analysis, involve self-referential fixed-point computations. Traditionally, these require complicated and difficult-to-maintain work-queue approaches due to a lack of native support in existing programming paradigms.

Method: The authors describe and explore the Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming (FPOP) paradigm. It leverages structured inference rules and user-directed optimizations to let developers specify problems declaratively, while the compiler handles efficient execution.

Result: FPOP enables concise and expressive problem formulations, drastically reducing implementation complexity and code size. For example, the graph distance problem can be solved with only two lines of executable FPOP code, compared to significantly more in other paradigms. The paradigm improves maintainability, adaptability, and supports rapid prototyping.

Conclusion: The FPOP paradigm bridges the gap between theoretical fixed-point formulations and practical implementations, streamlining development and fostering further research and adoption through its high-level abstractions.

Abstract: Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming (FPOP) is an emerging paradigm designed to
streamline the implementation of problems involving self-referential
computations. These include graph algorithms, static analysis, parsing, and
distributed computing-domains that traditionally require complex and
tricky-to-implement work-queue algorithms. Existing programming paradigms lack
direct support for these inherently fixed-point computations, leading to
inefficient and error-prone implementations.
  This white paper explores the potential of the FPOP paradigm, which offers a
high-level abstraction that enables concise and expressive problem
formulations. By leveraging structured inference rules and user-directed
optimizations, FPOP allows developers to write declarative specifications while
the compiler ensures efficient execution. It not only reduces implementation
complexity for programmers but also enhances adaptability, making it easier for
programmers to explore alternative solutions and optimizations without
modifying the core logic of their program.
  We demonstrate how FPOP simplifies algorithm implementation, improves
maintainability, and enables rapid prototyping by allowing problems to be
clearly and concisely expressed. For example, the graph distance problem can be
expressed in only two executable lines of code with FPOP, while it takes an
order of magnitude more code in other paradigms. By bridging the gap between
theoretical fixed-point formulations and practical implementations, we aim to
foster further research and adoption of this paradigm.

### [16] [Composable Effect Handling for Programming LLM-integrated Scripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22048)
*Di Wang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Separating workflow logic from effectful operations via composable effect handling greatly improves both modularity and speed (10x) for LLM-integrated scripts, and is recommended for future scripting practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-integrated scripts are tightly coupled to specific LLMs and do not effectively use parallelization, leading to challenges in modularity and performance.

Method: The paper introduces composable effect handling, which separates workflow logic from effectful operations (like LLM calls, I/O, concurrency) using abstract interfaces and effect handlers.

Result: Scripts using this method can achieve significant speedups (e.g., 10x in a Tree-of-Thoughts case study) while retaining modularity.

Conclusion: Composable effect handling enables both modular and high-performance LLM scripting and is recommended as a programming style for such applications.

Abstract: Implementing LLM-integrated scripts introduces challenges in modularity and
performance, as scripts are often coupled to specific LLM implementations and
fail to exploit parallelization opportunities. This paper proposes using
composable effect handling to separate workflow logic from effectful
operations, such as LLM calls, I/O, and concurrency, enabling modularity
without sacrificing the opportunity for performance optimization. By treating
these operations as abstract interfaces and discharging them via effect
handlers, this paper shows that scripts can achieve significant speedups (e.g.,
10$\times$ in a Tree-of-Thoughts case study) without compromising modularity.
This paper aims to promote composable effect handling as a programming style
for LLM scripting.
