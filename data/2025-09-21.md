TL;DR: DeliverC, a GenAI-powered game for learning C pointers, boosts student confidence and reduces errors, but faces challenges with feedback clarity and retention at higher difficulty. The study suggests that GenAI plus games can improve programming education, with room for refinement.

Motivation: Current game-based learning tools lack adaptive, real-time support for difficult programming topics such as C pointers. The motivation is to provide personalized and interactive practice to improve student understanding and confidence.

Method: The authors developed DeliverC, a GenAI-enhanced game using GPT-4-mini to offer adaptive hints and challenges on C pointers. They conducted a pilot study with 25 undergraduates, collecting gameplay data and analyzing responses to a 15-item survey on motivation, self-efficacy, metacognition, and feedback quality.

Result: Most students reported increased confidence and reflection after using DeliverC. Error rates dropped as students advanced in the game. However, participation waned with higher difficulty, and some students found AI feedback unclear or vague.

Conclusion: DeliverC shows promise in enhancing engagement and comprehension in systems programming. Its adaptive features and AI-generated practice support learning, but the feedback mechanism requires improvement for clearer guidance.

Abstract: While game-based learning is widely used in programming education, few tools
offer adaptive, real-time support for complex topics, such as C pointers. We
present DeliverC, a GenAI-enhanced game that integrates GPT-4-mini to provide
personalized hints and generate pointer-related challenges on the fly. In a
pilot study involving 25 undergraduate students, we investigated the impact of
the system on learning through gameplay data and a 15-item survey that covered
constructs such as motivation, self-efficacy, metacognition, and feedback
quality. Results show that most students felt more confident and reflective
after using the tool, and error rates decreased as students progressed through
scaffolded levels. However, participation decreased with task difficulty, and
some students reported receiving unclear or vague feedback. These findings
suggest that DeliverC can enhance engagement and understanding in systems
programming, although refinement in AI-generated feedback is still needed. Our
study highlights the potential of combining GenAI with game-based learning to
support personalized and interactive practice in traditionally challenging
programming domains.
