Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted, using a hybrid search strategy that included database searches and backward and forward snowballing. This resulted in the identification and analysis of 27 relevant papers published between 2008 and 2024.

Result: The study identified eight frameworks for agile management of ML-enabled systems and grouped recommendations into eight themes, including Iteration Flexibility and Minimal Viable Model. Accurate effort estimation for ML tasks emerged as a major challenge across the literature.

Conclusion: The paper maps the current state of research in agile management for ML-enabled systems and highlights existing accomplishments along with research gaps. There is a need for more empirical evaluation of agile approaches tailored to ML development.

Abstract: [Context] Machine learning (ML)-enabled systems are present in our society,
driving significant digital transformations. The dynamic nature of ML
development, characterized by experimental cycles and rapid changes in data,
poses challenges to traditional project management. Agile methods, with their
flexibility and incremental delivery, seem well-suited to address this
dynamism. However, it is unclear how to effectively apply these methods in the
context of ML-enabled systems, where challenges require tailored approaches.
[Goal] Our goal is to outline the state of the art in agile management for
ML-enabled systems. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study using a
hybrid search strategy that combines database searches with backward and
forward snowballing iterations. [Results] Our study identified 27 papers
published between 2008 and 2024. From these, we identified eight frameworks and
categorized recommendations and practices into eight key themes, such as
Iteration Flexibility, Innovative ML-specific Artifacts, and the Minimal Viable
Model. The main challenge identified across studies was accurate effort
estimation for ML-related tasks. [Conclusion] This study contributes by mapping
the state of the art and identifying open gaps in the field. While relevant
work exists, more robust empirical evaluation is still needed to validate these
contributions.

### [3] [Generating Reliable Adverse event Profiles for Health through Automated Integrated Data (GRAPH-AID): A Semi-Automated Ontology Building Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20851)
*Srikar Reddy Gadusu,Larry Callahan,Samir Lababidi,Arunasri Nishtala,Sophia Healey,Hande McGinty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes an easy-to-use Python-based solution for automatic ontology generation from Neo4j databases, demonstrated with a drug safety dataset, bridging technical gaps and enabling better data-driven public health outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the growing challenges of ontology generation as data volumes increase and content changes frequently. There is a specific need for practical tools to facilitate knowledge graph creation and integration of databases such as Neo4j with ontologies, especially for users unfamiliar with complex description logics syntax.

Method: The paper introduces a user-friendly approach utilizing Python and the rdflib library. The method automates the generation of ontology classes and their axioms from a Neo4j database, demonstrated using FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data to create a knowledge graph.

Result: The result is a practical, automated solution that simplifies ontology generation from Neo4j databases, reducing the technical barrier and facilitating smoother data integration. The system effectively generates ontological constructs needed for knowledge graphs, as shown via the FAERS dataset example.

Conclusion: The presented approach offers a practical and accessible means to automate ontology generation and knowledge graph integration from Neo4j databases. This supports more efficient drug safety monitoring and enhances public health decision-making.

Abstract: As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for
ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data
volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and
retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become
increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address
these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this
methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j
databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate
data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches
often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not
be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to
bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes
Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our
novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically
generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother
integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the
challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse
drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public
health decision-making.

### [4] [Engineering RAG Systems for Real-World Applications: Design, Development, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20869)
*Md Toufique Hasan,Muhammad Waseem,Kai-Kristian Kemell,Ayman Asad Khan,Mika Saari,Pekka Abrahamsson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper empirically evaluates five real-world RAG systems in diverse domains, using participant feedback to document practical lessons and challenges, providing actionable insights for future RAG deployment and research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the limited empirical evidence and practical guidance available on developing and deploying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in real-world scenarios, specifically focusing on factual accuracy, contextual relevance, and user experience.

Method: The authors developed five domain-specific RAG applications spanning governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. These systems utilized multilingual OCR, vector-based semantic retrieval, and domain-adapted LLMs. Systems were deployed through local servers or cloud APIs, evaluated via a web-based study with 100 participants assessing six key user experience dimensions.

Result: The evaluation provided user-driven insights, identifying strengths and limitations of RAG deployments in practical contexts. User feedback and development experiences culminated in the documentation of twelve key lessons addressing technical, operational, and ethical challenges to reliability and usability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the benefits and challenges of real-world RAG deployment, offering empirically-grounded lessons crucial for practitioners and researchers aiming to implement RAG systems across various domains.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach
for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing
limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a
lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based
implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general
user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons
learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed
for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture,
industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates
multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted
LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs.
A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the
systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii)
Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of
Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we
documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and
ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in
practice.

### [5] [Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20883)
*Kyanna Dagenais,Istvan David*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Combining reinforcement learning and human guidance helps automate and improve the efficiency of creating complex sequences of model transformations, with human input (even if uncertain) making RL tools more effective and practical in engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing complex model transformations (MTs) in model-driven engineering is often manual, error-prone, and sometimes infeasible. Reinforcement learning (RL) can automate this process but struggles with performance on complex problems, highlighting the need for improved methods.

Method: The paper introduces a framework that maps user-defined model transformations to RL primitives and executes them as RL programs. It incorporates potentially uncertain human advice to guide the RL agent, improving its efficiency in finding optimal MT sequences.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that integrating human guidance—even if it's uncertain—significantly boosts RL performance, enabling more efficient and effective development of complex MTs.

Conclusion: The proposed human-in-the-loop RL framework effectively enhances the development process of complex model transformations by leveraging both RL capabilities and human input, balancing the reliability and promptness of human advice for optimal outcomes.

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations
(MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of
such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design
space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often
infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate
these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial
and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL
methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,
human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach
and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided
by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to
be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal
MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,
substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient
development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and
timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven
human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

### [6] [Boosting Vulnerability Detection with Inter-function Multilateral Association Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21014)
*Shaojian Qiu,Mengyang Huang,Jiahao Cheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces IFMA-VD, a new framework that models complex relationships between software functions using hypergraphs to improve vulnerability detection, achieving better performance than previous methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing deep learning-based vulnerability detection methods focus only on individual functions and ignore complex relationships between functions, especially multilateral associations. This limited perspective can cause such methods to miss vulnerabilities that arise from these interactions.

Method: The authors propose IFMA-VD, a framework that constructs a code behavior hypergraph and applies hyperedge convolution to extract features representing multilateral associations among functions. The process includes parsing functions into code property graphs to create intra-function features, building a code behavior hypergraph from segmented program dependency graphs, and then capturing the association knowledge using a hypergraph network.

Result: Experimental evaluation on three popular vulnerability datasets shows that IFMA-VD outperforms baseline methods in F-measure and Recall. The addition of multilateral association features improves code feature representation, and the framework is validated to be effective on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: IFMA-VD addresses the limitations of prior methods by modeling complex inter-function associations, resulting in better vulnerability detection performance. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through improved results on standard datasets and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vulnerability detection is a crucial yet challenging technique for ensuring
the security of software systems. Currently, most deep learning-based
vulnerability detection methods focus on stand-alone functions, neglecting the
complex inter-function interrelations, particularly the multilateral
associations. This oversight can fail to detect vulnerabilities in these
interrelations. To address this gap, we present an Inter-Function Multilateral
Association analysis framework for Vulnerability Detection (IFMA-VD). The
cornerstone of the IFMA-VD lies in constructing a code behavior hypergraph and
utilizing hyperedge convolution to extract multilateral association features.
Specifically, we first parse functions into a code property graph to generate
intra-function features. Following this, we construct a code behavior
hypergraph by segmenting the program dependency graph to isolate and encode
behavioral features into hyperedges. Finally, we utilize a hypergraph network
to capture the multilateral association knowledge for augmenting vulnerability
detection. We evaluate IFMA-VD on three widely used vulnerability datasets and
demonstrate improvements in F-measure and Recall compared to baseline methods.
Additionally, we illustrate that multilateral association features can boost
code feature representation and validate the effectiveness of IFMA-VD on
real-world datasets.

### [7] [How Good Are Synthetic Requirements ? Evaluating LLM-Generated Datasets for AI4RE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21138)
*Abdelkarim El-Hajjami,Camille Salinesi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Synthline v1 offers an advanced, systematic approach to generating synthetic requirements data using LLMs. Through careful prompting, automated optimization, and curation, the method not only produces diverse, high-quality datasets but in some cases surpasses human-authored data, supporting the advancement of AI in requirements engineering despite dataset shortages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is the scarcity of labeled requirements datasets, which hinders progress in applying Artificial Intelligence to Requirements Engineering (AI4RE). There is a specific need for systematic methods to generate high-quality synthetic requirements data using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: The authors introduce Synthline v1, an improved Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements datasets. They incorporate advanced generation strategies, automated prompt optimization (using PACE), and post-generation curation. Four research questions are studied across four classification tasks to evaluate how these methods affect data quality.

Result: Results demonstrate that multi-sample prompting increases both utility and diversity, with F1-score improvements of 6 to 44 points compared to single-sample generation. Automated prompt optimization via PACE shows task-dependent effects, significantly aiding functional classification but sometimes reducing performance in other tasks. Similarity-based curation enhances diversity but can hurt classification performance. Critically, synthetic data can equal or surpass human-authored data for several tasks, particularly security (+7.8 points) and defect classification (+15.4 points).

Conclusion: Systematic methods for LLM-based synthetic requirements data generation are effective and can produce data of equal or greater quality than human-generated equivalents in some tasks. These techniques can help address the data scarcity problem in AI4RE.

Abstract: The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a
major barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering
(AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic
data generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of
generated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,
an enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data
that extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and
curation techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how
prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation
curation affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect
detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security
vs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting
significantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,
with F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic
Editing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,
greatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing
performance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves
diversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some
redundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that
synthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific
tasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and
defect classification (+15.4 points). These findings offer practical insights
for AI4RE and chart a viable path to mitigating dataset scarcity through
systematic synthetic generation.

### [8] [$T^3$: Multi-level Tree-based Automatic Program Repair with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21211)
*Quanming Liu,Xupeng Bu,Zhichao Yan,Ru Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents T^3, a framework that merges large language models' reasoning with tree search to improve automatic program repair, resulting in more precise and efficient bug fixes with minimal human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic Program Repair (APR) aims to fix software defects with minimal human input, but the application of advanced reasoning techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) from large language models (LLMs), has been limited in APR due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning required.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates several common Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in APR tasks and introduces a novel framework called T^3. T^3 combines LLMs' reasoning abilities with a tree search approach to enhance the precision of generating candidate repair solutions.

Result: The proposed T^3 framework significantly improves the quality of candidate repairs in APR and offers effective guidance for both sample selection and repair strategy formulation, leading to more efficient automated debugging.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-based reasoning and tree search within the T^3 framework provides a robust and effective solution for automatic program repair, addressing previous limitations in applying CoT to APR and paving the way for better automated defect fixing strategies.

Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development
and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human
intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the
complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT
techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and
proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning
capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of
generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable
guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks,
establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.

### [9] [KOALA: a Configurable Tool for Collecting IDE Data When Solving Programming Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21266)
*Daniil Karol,Elizaveta Artser,Ilya Vlasov,Yaroslav Golubev,Hieke Keuning,Anastasiia Birillo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: KOALA is a flexible data collection plugin for JetBrains IDEs, enabling educators and researchers to capture detailed, configurable programming activity data from students, overcoming the limitations of previous tools. Initial deployment showed it can reveal new insights into student learning behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for collecting data on students solving programming tasks have notable limitations, such as lack of control over data granularity, incomplete event capture, and complex configuration. There is a need for a more flexible and comprehensive tool for researchers and educators to better analyze and support student learning in programming environments.

Method: The authors developed KOALA, a configurable plugin for JetBrains IDEs, which collects code snapshots and monitors a variety of IDE interactions during students' problem solving. KOALA can be set up to control task distribution, enable/disable IDE features, conduct surveys, and capture data at customizable granularities. The collected data is sent to a server and can be converted into a standardized format (ProgSnap2) for further analysis.

Result: The tool was deployed in two courses, collecting data from 28 students. The data included detailed records of code snapshots, IDE actions, and user behavior not typically captured by previous tools, such as hotkey usage and file-switching frequency. Initial analysis highlighted new insights into student learning and behavior within programming tasks.

Conclusion: KOALA offers a significant advancement in data collection for programming education research, providing richer and more configurable datasets than previous tools. Its deployment demonstrated both the feasibility and the value of capturing a broader spectrum of student activity in educational programming environments.

Abstract: Collecting data of students solving programming tasks is incredibly valuable
for researchers and educators. It allows verifying that the students correctly
apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students'
misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g.,
no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the
specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to
configure.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly
configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students
solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in
IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or
disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During
problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured
granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data
not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between
files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where
it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To
showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two
courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.

### [10] [Exploring Micro Frontends: A Case Study Application in E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21297)
*Ricardo Hideki Hangai Kojo,Luiz Fernando Corte Real,Renato Cordeiro Ferreira,Thatiane de Oliveira Rosa,Alfredo Goldman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Adopting micro frontends in a marketplace improved scalability and developer experience, but was not strictly necessary—other solutions could work as well. The migration made sense mainly because the company was already breaking up a monolith and using microservices, enabling easier implementation and team collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to evaluate when adopting micro frontends is worthwhile, particularly in industrial contexts where challenges such as tight system coupling, deprecated technologies, and poor developer experience are present.

Method: The authors conducted a review of both academic and gray literature on micro frontends, implemented the micro frontend architecture in a real-world handcrafted products marketplace (which already used microservices), and then evaluated the implementation via a semi-open questionnaire with developers.

Result: The findings revealed that, although the adoption of micro frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the organization's goals. Other approaches, like a monolithic frontend, could have also fulfilled the needs. The decision to adopt micro frontends was primarily influenced by ongoing monolith strangulation, existing microservices, and the benefits of infrastructure and knowledge reuse.

Conclusion: Micro frontends can be a convenient choice in environments already moving towards microservices and monolith decomposition, but they introduce additional complexity and may not always be required for achieving organizational goals. Alternatives should be carefully considered based on context.

Abstract: In the micro frontends architectural style, the frontend is divided into
smaller components, which can range from a simple button to an entire page. The
goal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at
the cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks
to understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the
context of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the
state of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray
literature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for
handcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated
the implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At
the studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to
the tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated
frontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor
developer experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture
was adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and
technologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro
Frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's
needs. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other
alternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable
results. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the
company's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,
which facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge
sharing between teams.

### [11] [An object-centric core metamodel for IoT-enhanced event logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21300)
*Yannis Bertrand,Christian Imenkamp,Lukas Malburg,Matthias Ehrendorfer,Marco Franceschetti,Joscha Grüger,Francesco Leotta,Jürgen Mangler,Ronny Seiger,Agnes Koschmider,Stefanie Rinderle-Ma,Barbara Weber,Estefania Serral*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A new core data model is introduced to bridge IoT and process event data, overcoming existing fragmentation and enabling easier data sharing and collaboration in process mining. A Python prototype shows the model works across different use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of IoT devices into business processes generates vast amounts of diverse data, revealing new insights through process mining. However, merging IoT data with traditional event data is challenging due to different data characteristics and fragmented data models, which hinders data sharing and collaboration.

Method: The authors propose a core data model that synthesizes key features from existing models, driven by shared requirements. They implement a Python prototype to validate the model against multiple use cases, checking whether it meets these requirements.

Result: The proposed core model successfully addresses the challenge of integrating IoT and process data, facilitating data sharing and collaboration. The Python prototype demonstrates the model's applicability and effectiveness across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified, requirement-driven data model that streamlines the integration of IoT and process data for process mining, promoting easier data exchange and increasing collaborative potential in the field.

Abstract: Advances in Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have prompted the
integration of IoT devices with business processes (BPs) in many organizations
across various sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare and smart spaces. The
proliferation of IoT devices leads to the generation of large amounts of IoT
data providing a window on the physical context of BPs, which facilitates the
discovery of new insights about BPs using process mining (PM) techniques.
However, to achieve these benefits, IoT data need to be combined with
traditional process (event) data, which is challenging due to the very
different characteristics of IoT and process data, for instance in terms of
granularity levels. Recently, several data models were proposed to integrate
IoT data with process data, each focusing on different aspects of data
integration based on different assumptions and requirements. This fragmentation
hampers data exchange and collaboration in the field of PM, e.g., making it
tedious for researchers to share data. In this paper, we present a core model
synthesizing the most important features of existing data models. As the core
model is based on common requirements, it greatly facilitates data sharing and
collaboration in the field. A prototypical Python implementation is used to
evaluate the model against various use cases and demonstrate that it satisfies
these common requirements.
