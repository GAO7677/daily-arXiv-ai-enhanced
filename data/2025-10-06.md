Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Code World Model (CWM) is a large open-weights LLM designed to advance code generation by incorporating world modeling and reasoning from dynamic environments, demonstrating strong results on benchmarks and supporting further research through released checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve code generation by going beyond static code understanding, leveraging world modeling and reasoning using dynamic computational environments.

Method: CWM was mid-trained on observation-action trajectories from Python interpreter and Docker environments, followed by multi-task reasoning reinforcement learning (RL) in coding, math, and software engineering tasks. Model checkpoints were released at various stages: after mid-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and RL.

Result: CWM shows high scores on coding and math tasks, such as 65.8% pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified, 68.6% on LiveCodeBench, 96.6% on Math-500, and 76.0% on AIME 2024. It also enables step-by-step Python execution simulation and agentic coding.

Conclusion: The release of the 32B-parameter Code World Model (CWM) provides a powerful tool for advancing code generation with reasoning and planning capabilities. CWM demonstrates strong performance on coding and math benchmarks and serves as a testbed for future research in agentic coding and code world modeling.

Abstract: We release Code World Model (CWM), a 32-billion-parameter open-weights LLM,
to advance research on code generation with world models. To improve code
understanding beyond what can be learned from training on static code alone, we
mid-train CWM on a large amount of observation-action trajectories from Python
interpreter and agentic Docker environments, and perform extensive multi-task
reasoning RL in verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering
environments. With CWM, we provide a strong testbed for researchers to explore
the opportunities world modeling affords for improving code generation with
reasoning and planning in computational environments. We present first steps of
how world models can benefit agentic coding, enable step-by-step simulation of
Python code execution, and show early results of how reasoning can benefit from
the latter. CWM is a dense, decoder-only LLM trained with a context size of up
to 131k tokens. Independent of its world modeling capabilities, CWM offers
strong performance on general coding and math tasks: it reaches pass@1 scores
of 65.8% on SWE-bench Verified (with test-time scaling), 68.6% on
LiveCodeBench, 96.6% on Math-500, and 76.0% on AIME 2024. To support further
research on code world modeling, we release model checkpoints after
mid-training, SFT, and RL.

### [2] [From Trace to Line: LLM Agent for Real-World OSS Vulnerability Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02389)
*Haoran Xi,Minghao Shao,Brendan Dolan-Gavitt,Muhammad Shafique,Ramesh Karri*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: T2L-Agent is a new LLM-driven framework for vulnerability detection that moves beyond file-level predictions to line-level diagnosis and patch recommendations, achieving significantly better results on a rigorous new benchmark compared to prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language model approaches to vulnerability discovery are limited by their coarse detection granularity, isolated code analysis, and struggles with long context sizes. This provides limited actionable information to engineers who require precise localization and targeted patch suggestions for effective real-world software development.

Method: The proposed method introduces T2L-Agent, an end-to-end framework that leverages an Agentic Trace Analyzer (ATA) which combines runtime evidence (e.g., crash points, stack traces, coverage deltas) with AST-based code chunking. The system utilizes multi-round feedback and progressive narrowing from modules to exact code lines, enabling iterative refinement and translation of symptoms into line-level diagnoses.

Result: On the new T2L-ARVO benchmark—a collection of 50 diverse, expert-verified vulnerability cases spanning five crash families and various real-world projects—T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection accuracy and 54.8% line-level localization accuracy, substantially outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: T2L-Agent, coupled with the T2L-ARVO benchmark, significantly advances LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse-grained identification to precise, actionable line-level diagnostics, achieving notable improvements over existing methods and promising to accelerate patching in real-world software development.

Abstract: Large language models show promise for vulnerability discovery, yet
prevailing methods inspect code in isolation, struggle with long contexts, and
focus on coarse function- or file-level detections - offering limited
actionable guidance to engineers who need precise line-level localization and
targeted patches in real-world software development. We present T2L-Agent
(Trace-to-Line Agent), a project-level, end-to-end framework that plans its own
analysis and progressively narrows scope from modules to exact vulnerable
lines. T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer
(ATA) that fuses runtime evidence - crash points, stack traces, and coverage
deltas - with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond
single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level
diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce
T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash
families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support
both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous
evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On
T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level
localization, substantially outperforming baselines. Together, the framework
and benchmark push LLM-based vulnerability detection from coarse identification
toward deployable, robust, precision diagnostics that reduce noise and
accelerate patching in open-source software workflows.

### [3] [AP2O: Correcting LLM-Generated Code Errors Type by Type Like Humans via Adaptive Progressive Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02393)
*Jianqing Zhang,Wei Xia,Hande Dong,Qiang Lin,Jian Cao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AP2O-Coder is a new training method that uses specific error-type feedback and adaptive replay to help LLMs generate better code, improving accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have greatly improved code generation, but generated code still often contains compilation and runtime errors. Existing optimization methods mainly use pass/fail signals and do not consider specific error types, limiting performance gains.

Method: The proposed method, AP2O-Coder, constructs an error notebook from failed code samples and progressively optimizes the LLM to correct different error types. It also adaptively replays error types during training to match the model's evolving weaknesses.

Result: AP2O-Coder achieves up to 3% improvement in code generation performance (measured by pass@k) across multiple LLMs (Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) and size scales, while requiring less preference data.

Conclusion: Error-type-aware and adaptive replay optimization can reduce code errors in LLM-generated code more efficiently than traditional pass/fail-based optimization methods.

Abstract: LLMs' code generation capabilities have yielded substantial improvements in
the effectiveness of programming tasks. However, LLM-generated code still
suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference
optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using
pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error
types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive
Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that
guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code
generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and
progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we
adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses
throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and
general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from
0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in
pass@k while using less preference data. Code: https://github.com/TsingZ0/AP2O

### [4] [Dynamic Function Configuration and its Management in Serverless Computing: A Taxonomy and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02404)
*Siddharth Agarwal,Maria A. Rodriguez,Rajkumar Buyya*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper surveys and categorizes factors affecting resource configuration in serverless Function-as-a-Service platforms, highlighting platform-specific challenges and the need for improved, automated configuration tools. It outlines current research, identifies gaps, and suggests future directions to simplify and optimize function configuration in cloud environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serverless cloud computing simplifies infrastructure management for developers, but optimal resource configuration (especially in Function-as-a-Service) remains challenging due to limited platform transparency and complex, platform-dependent resource relationships. Both over- and under-provisioning can affect cost and performance, and developers lack practical guidelines.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy of factors influencing FaaS resource configuration, analyze and review existing literature on the topic, and identify research gaps and future directions in function configuration in serverless environments.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy categorizing the factors affecting FaaS resource configuration, and systematically reviews existing studies. It identifies key research gaps and open challenges, providing suggestions for future research that could improve configuration processes and serverless platform capabilities.

Conclusion: Optimal resource configuration in serverless environments is non-trivial and heavily influenced by platform characteristics. There is a need for more transparent, automated, and intelligent configuration tools to help developers optimize cost and performance, and to support broader serverless adoption. Research must address these gaps.

Abstract: The serverless cloud computing model offers a framework where the service
provider abstracts the underlying infrastructure management from developers. In
this serverless model, FaaS provides an event-driven, function-oriented
computing service characterised by fine-grained, usage-based pricing that
eliminates cost for idle resources. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions,
and Cloud Run Functions require developers to configure their function(s) with
minimum operational resources for its successful execution. This resource
allocation influences both the operational expense and the performance quality
of these functions. However, a noticeable lack of platform transparency forces
developers to rely on expert knowledge or experience-based ad-hoc decisions to
request desired function resources. This makes optimal resource configuration a
non-trivial task while adhering to performance constraints. Furthermore, while
commercial platforms often scale resources like CPU and network bandwidth
proportional to memory, open-source frameworks permit independent configuration
of function resources, introducing additional complexity for developers aiming
to optimise their functions. These complexities have directed researchers to
resolve developer challenges and advance towards an efficient server-less
execution model. In this article, we identify different aspects of resource
configuration techniques in FaaS settings and propose a taxonomy of factors
that influence function design, configuration, run-time cost, and performance
guarantees. We conduct an analysis of existing literature on resource
configuration to present a comprehensive review of current studies on function
configuration. We also identify existing research gaps and suggest future
research directions to enhance function configuration and strengthen the
capabilities of serverless computing environments to drive its broader
adoption.

### [5] [Product Manager Practices for Delegating Work to Generative AI: "Accountability must not be delegated to non-human actors"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02504)
*Mara Ulloa,Jenna L. Butler,Sankeerti Haniyur,Courtney Miller,Barrett Amos,Advait Sarkar,Margaret-Anne Storey*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how Generative AI is transforming the role and practices of Product Managers in software development, offering a detailed view of adoption, adaptation, and implications for future workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI is significantly impacting knowledge work, particularly for Product Managers in software development. Previous research has mainly focused on developers, leaving a gap in understanding how GenAI affects PMs specifically. The paper aims to address this lack of knowledge and provide actionable insights.

Method: The authors conducted a mixed-methods study at Microsoft, combining a survey of 885 PMs, telemetry data analysis for 731 PMs, and interviews with 15 PMs.

Result: The study provides: 1) GenAI adoption rates among PMs, their use cases, benefits, and barriers; 2) a framework for how PMs decide which tasks to delegate to GenAI; and 3) insights into PM adaptation and evolving perceptions of their role due to GenAI integration.

Conclusion: PMs are adopting GenAI with varying rates and strategies, leveraging it for several tasks while facing specific benefits and challenges. Their roles are evolving as they integrate GenAI, which has broader implications on workflow and software development roles.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is changing the nature of knowledge work, particularly
for Product Managers (PMs) in software development teams. While much software
engineering research has focused on developers' interactions with GenAI, there
is less understanding of how the work of PMs is evolving due to GenAI. To
address this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods study at Microsoft, a large,
multinational software company: surveying 885 PMs, analyzing telemetry data for
a subset of PMs (N=731), and interviewing a subset of 15 PMs. We contribute:
(1) PMs' current GenAI adoption rates, uses cases, and perceived benefits and
barriers and; (2) a framework capturing how PMs assess which tasks to delegate
to GenAI; (3) PMs adaptation practices for integrating GenAI into their roles
and perceptions of how their role is evolving. We end by discussing
implications on the broader GenAI workflow adoption process and software
development roles.

### [6] [ZeroFalse: Improving Precision in Static Analysis with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02534)
*Mohsen Iranmanesh,Sina Moradi Sabet,Sina Marefat,Ali Javidi Ghasr,Allison Wilson,Iman Sharafaldin,Mohammad A. Tayebi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ZeroFalse uses LLMs to smartly filter and enrich static analyzer results, slashing false positives and maintaining high precision/recall. It is practical for real-world software pipelines and demonstrates that tailored prompting and reasoning-optimized models are most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are widely used in software development but suffer from high rates of false positives. This erodes developer trust and incurs significant manual effort to triage alerts, preventing more effective adoption of these tools.

Method: ZeroFalse is introduced as a framework that combines static analysis outputs with large language models (LLMs). It formats analyzer findings as structured contracts, adds flow-sensitive traces, contextual evidence, and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-specific knowledge, then provides these enriched outputs to an LLM for adjudication. The framework was tested using ten state-of-the-art LLMs on both benchmarks and real-world projects.

Result: ZeroFalse achieved F1-scores of 0.912 on the OWASP Java Benchmark and 0.955 on the OpenVuln dataset, with both recall and precision above 90%. CWE-specialized prompting improved performance over generic prompts, and reasoning-oriented LLMs provided the best balance of precision and recall.

Conclusion: ZeroFalse significantly reduces false positives while maintaining high detection coverage, improving SAST trustworthiness and enabling more practical integration into CI/CD pipelines. Specialized prompting and reasoning-focused models are key to its effectiveness.

Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are integral to modern
software development, yet their adoption is undermined by excessive false
positives that weaken developer trust and demand costly manual triage. We
present ZeroFalse, a framework that integrates static analysis with large
language models (LLMs) to reduce false positives while preserving coverage.
ZeroFalse treats static analyzer outputs as structured contracts, enriching
them with flow-sensitive traces, contextual evidence, and CWE-specific
knowledge before adjudication by an LLM. This design preserves the systematic
reach of static analysis while leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
We evaluate ZeroFalse across both benchmarks and real-world projects using ten
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our best-performing models achieve F1-scores of 0.912 on
the OWASP Java Benchmark and 0.955 on the OpenVuln dataset, maintaining recall
and precision above 90%. Results further show that CWE-specialized prompting
consistently outperforms generic prompts, and reasoning-oriented LLMs provide
the most reliable precision-recall balance. These findings position ZeroFalse
as a practical and scalable approach for enhancing the reliability of SAST and
supporting its integration into real-world CI/CD pipelines.

### [7] [Key Considerations for Auto-Scaling: Lessons from Benchmark Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02585)
*Majid Dashtbani,Ladan Tahvildari*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Effective auto-scaling in microservices requires considering architectural, implementation, and deployment factors throughout the software lifecycle. Ignoring these leads to poor performance, but lifecycle-aware practices improve autoscaling stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-scaling in microservice-based cloud systems is challenging because it requires not only advanced technical solutions but also robust lifecycle management in architecture, implementation, and deployment. Existing benchmarks often neglect these foundational areas, limiting practical evaluation and progress.

Method: The authors identify practical auto-scaling considerations by applying state-of-the-art autoscaling techniques to popular microservice benchmarks. They organize the findings by lifecycle stage—architecture, implementation, and deployment—and validate their analysis with the Sock-Shop benchmark. Multiple autoscaling strategies (threshold-based, control-theoretic, learning-based, optimization, and dependency-aware) are evaluated.

Result: The study finds that ignoring lifecycle-specific concerns negatively impacts autoscaler performance. Addressing these considerations improves both automation stability and resource efficiency.

Conclusion: Lifecycle-aware engineering practices are essential for effective auto-scaling in microservice environments. Attention to architectural, implementation, and deployment issues enables scalable, robust, and efficient scaling solutions. Existing benchmarks should evolve to better reflect these lifecycle realities.

Abstract: Microservices have become the dominant architectural paradigm for building
scalable and modular cloud-native systems. However, achieving effective
auto-scaling in such systems remains a non-trivial challenge, as it depends not
only on advanced scaling techniques but also on sound design, implementation,
and deployment practices. Yet, these foundational aspects are often overlooked
in existing benchmarks, making it difficult to evaluate autoscaling methods
under realistic conditions. In this paper, we identify a set of practical
auto-scaling considerations by applying several state-of-the-art autoscaling
methods to widely used microservice benchmarks. To structure these findings, we
classify the issues based on when they arise during the software lifecycle:
Architecture, Implementation, and Deployment. The Architecture phase covers
high-level decisions such as service decomposition and inter-service
dependencies. The Implementation phase includes aspects like initialization
overhead, metrics instrumentation, and error propagation. The Deployment phase
focuses on runtime configurations such as resource limits and health checks. We
validate these considerations using the Sock-Shop benchmark and evaluate
diverse auto-scaling strategies, including threshold-based, control-theoretic,
learning-based, black-box optimization, and dependency-aware approaches. Our
findings show that overlooking key lifecycle concerns can degrade autoscaler
performance, while addressing them leads to more stable and efficient scaling.
These results underscore the importance of lifecycle-aware engineering for
unlocking the full potential of auto-scaling in microservice-based systems.

### [8] [RedCodeAgent: Automatic Red-teaming Agent against Diverse Code Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02609)
*Chengquan Guo,Chulin Xie,Yu Yang,Zhaorun Chen,Zinan Lin,Xander Davies,Yarin Gal,Dawn Song,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RedCodeAgent is a new automated tool that systematically finds security vulnerabilities in code agents, outperforming existing methods by using adaptive techniques and simulated environments. It reveals hidden risks in real code assistants, making safety assessments more efficient and thorough.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code agents have become widely used for their powerful code generation and dynamic interaction but bring safety and security risks, with current benchmarks failing to capture new, complex vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors introduce RedCodeAgent, an automated red-teaming agent with an adaptive memory module that selects and combines jailbreak and red-teaming tools intelligently for each input. It evaluates vulnerabilities using dynamic simulation sandboxes rather than static code inspection.

Result: RedCodeAgent outperforms current red-teaming techniques, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates across multiple code agents, risky scenarios, and programming languages. It even exposes previously unknown security issues in popular real-world code assistants.

Conclusion: RedCodeAgent offers a scalable and systematic approach to uncovering vulnerabilities in code agents, exceeding the capabilities of static benchmarks and previous tools, and provides effective automated safety assessments.

Abstract: Code agents have gained widespread adoption due to their strong code
generation capabilities and integration with code interpreters, enabling
dynamic execution, debugging, and interactive programming capabilities. While
these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also
introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks
and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky
scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the
combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose
RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically
uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module,
RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the
most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox
for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise
be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox
environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents,
mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code.
Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents,
diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent
consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack
success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further
validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium,
exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing
red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective
safety assessments of code agents.

### [9] [Automatic Building Code Review: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02634)
*Hanlong Wan,Weili Xu,Michael Rosenberg,Jian Zhang,Aysha Siddika*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces an agent-driven framework linking BIM data extraction with automated code verification using LLMs, RAG, and MCP agents. It demonstrates scalable, reliable, and efficient automated building code reviews, with GPT-4o as the top-performing model and MCP pipelines outperforming RAG reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual building code reviews in rural or resource-limited jurisdictions are labor-intensive, error-prone, and expensive, especially as building projects grow in complexity. There is a need to automate the review process using emerging technologies like BIM and LLMs.

Method: The proposed framework integrates BIM data extraction with automated verification using two techniques: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent pipelines. It uses LLM-driven agents to extract data from various files and checks compliance using the US DOE COMcheck engine (via API) for deterministic results and RAG reasoning for ambiguous cases. Multiple LLMs are evaluated for performance.

Result: Automated attribute extraction, schedule parsing, and validation against ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2022 were successfully demonstrated. GPT-4o was the most efficient and stable LLM. MCP agent pipelines were more rigorous and reliable than RAG. The framework proved scalable, interoperable, and production-ready for bridging BIM with code review.

Conclusion: The integration of BIM and LLM technologies via the agent-driven framework effectively automates building code review, especially benefitting resource-constrained jurisdictions. MCP agent pipelines provide a reliable, rigorous approach, enabling scalable, production-ready solutions for automated code review (ACR).

Abstract: Building officials, particularly those in resource-constrained or rural
jurisdictions, face labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly manual reviews of
design documents as projects increase in size and complexity. The growing
adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents opportunities for automated code review (ACR) solutions. This
study introduces a novel agent-driven framework that integrates BIM-based data
extraction with automated verification using both retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent pipelines. The
framework employs LLM-enabled agents to extract geometry, schedules, and system
attributes from heterogeneous file types, which are then processed for building
code checking through two complementary mechanisms: (1) direct API calls to the
US Department of Energy COMcheck engine, providing deterministic and
audit-ready outputs, and (2) RAG-based reasoning over rule provisions, enabling
flexible interpretation where coverage is incomplete or ambiguous.
  The framework was evaluated through case demonstrations, including automated
extraction of geometric attributes (such as surface area, tilt, and insulation
values), parsing of operational schedules, and validation of lighting
allowances under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2022. Comparative performance tests
across multiple LLMs showed that GPT-4o achieved the best balance of efficiency
and stability, while smaller models exhibited inconsistencies or failures.
Results confirm that MCP agent pipelines outperform RAG reasoning pipelines in
rigor and reliability. This work advances ACR research by demonstrating a
scalable, interoperable, and production-ready approach that bridges BIM with
authoritative code review tools.

### [10] [Using Fourier Analysis and Mutant Clustering to Accelerate DNN Mutation Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02718)
*Ali Ghanbari,Sasan Tavakkol*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DM#, a Fourier analysis-based method to cluster and select DNN mutants for faster mutation testing. DM# accelerates testing by 28%, keeps error under 1%, and outperforms several existing selection strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mutation analysis is a powerful way to assess the adequacy of test sets for deep neural networks (DNNs), but its high computational cost hampers practical use, due to the large numbers of mutants and dataset sizes involved.

Method: The authors propose DM#, a technique using Fourier analysis to quantify the behavior of DNN mutants with only a few data points. Mutants are clustered based on this quantified behavior, and representative mutants from each cluster are selected for testing, which reduces the overall testing burden by generalizing test results to similar mutants.

Result: When evaluated on 14 DNN models of various sizes and datasets, DM# accelerated mutation testing by 28.38% on average with only a 0.72% average error in mutation score. It also yielded significantly less mutation score error compared to traditional random, boundary sample, and random sample selection techniques, while achieving comparable speed-up.

Conclusion: DM# is effective at reducing the cost and error in mutation testing of DNNs, allowing for practical evaluation of test set adequacy with greater efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) mutation analysis is a promising approach to
evaluating test set adequacy. Due to the large number of generated mutants that
must be tested on large datasets, mutation analysis is costly. In this paper,
we present a technique, named DM#, for accelerating DNN mutation testing using
Fourier analysis. The key insight is that DNN outputs are real-valued functions
suitable for Fourier analysis that can be leveraged to quantify mutant behavior
using only a few data points. DM# uses the quantified mutant behavior to
cluster the mutants so that the ones with similar behavior fall into the same
group. A representative from each group is then selected for testing, and the
result of the test, e.g., whether the mutant is killed or survived, is reused
for all other mutants represented by the selected mutant, obviating the need
for testing other mutants. 14 DNN models of sizes ranging from thousands to
millions of parameters, trained on different datasets, are used to evaluate DM#
and compare it to several baseline techniques. Our results provide empirical
evidence on the effectiveness of DM# in accelerating mutation testing by
28.38%, on average, at the average cost of only 0.72% error in mutation score.
Moreover, on average, DM# incurs 11.78, 15.16, and 114.36 times less mutation
score error compared to random mutant selection, boundary sample selection, and
random sample selection techniques, respectively, while generally offering
comparable speed-up.

### [11] [Automated Repair of OpenID Connect Programs (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02773)
*Tamjid Al Rahat,Yanju Chen,Yu Feng,Yuan Tian*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AuthFix is an automated repair tool leveraging LLMs and Petri-nets to fix OpenID Connect security bugs. It correctly patched 74% of tested issues, often matching developer-written solutions, showing strong potential for enhancing authentication security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite OpenID Connect's role in enhancing online authentication security and convenience, it remains vulnerable to critical security bugs, resulting in financial losses and breaches. There is a pressing need for automated, robust mitigation and repair solutions tailored to the unique challenges of OpenID security flaws.

Method: The paper introduces AuthFix, an automated program repair engine guided by counterexamples and powered by large language models (LLMs). AuthFix comprises three main components: fault localization, patch synthesis, and patch verification. The verification uses a novel Petri-net-based model checker to accurately model protocol interactions and ensure correctness of generated patches.

Result: AuthFix was evaluated against a dataset of OpenID bugs. It successfully generated correct patches for 17 out of 23 bugs (74%), and many of these patches were semantically equivalent to those written by developers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LLM-guided, counterexample-based automated repair tools like AuthFix can effectively address real-world OpenID security bugs. This approach offers a viable and efficient method to improve the security and reliability of authentication systems.

Abstract: OpenID Connect has revolutionized online authentication based on single
sign-on (SSO) by providing a secure and convenient method for accessing
multiple services with a single set of credentials. Despite its widespread
adoption, critical security bugs in OpenID Connect have resulted in significant
financial losses and security breaches, highlighting the need for robust
mitigation strategies. Automated program repair presents a promising solution
for generating candidate patches for OpenID implementations. However,
challenges such as domain-specific complexities and the necessity for precise
fault localization and patch verification must be addressed. We propose
AuthFix, a counterexample-guided repair engine leveraging LLMs for automated
OpenID bug fixing. AuthFix integrates three key components: fault localization,
patch synthesis, and patch verification. By employing a novel Petri-net-based
model checker, AuthFix ensures the correctness of patches by effectively
modeling interactions. Our evaluation on a dataset of OpenID bugs demonstrates
that AuthFix successfully generated correct patches for 17 out of 23 bugs
(74%), with a high proportion of patches semantically equivalent to
developer-written fixes.

### [12] [C2|Q>: A Robust Framework for Bridging Classical and Quantum Software Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02854)
*Boshuai Ye,Arif Ali Khan,Teemu Pihkakoski,Peng Liang,Muhammad Azeem Akbar,Matti Silveri,Lauri Malmi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: C2|Q> is an open-source framework that lets classical developers write quantum programs by translating classical code into quantum-executable tasks. It automates problem encoding, circuit creation, hardware selection, and result decoding, achieving high completion rates and massively reducing manual effort. C2|Q> helps make quantum computing more accessible and practical for conventional software engineers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum software engineering is hampered by the complexity and low-level nature of quantum development environments, making them hard for classical software engineers to adopt. There is a need for frameworks that bridge the gap between classical and quantum program specifications, bringing accessibility and methodological rigor.

Method: The paper presents C2|Q>, a modular quantum software development framework. C2|Q> is hardware-agnostic and processes classical code into quantum-executable programs by separating the workflow into three modules: encoder (problem classification, generation of quantum circuit), deployment (circuit generation, hardware recommendation based on performance metrics), and decoder (result interpretation). The system is evaluated on typical quantum workloads using classical specifications and public quantum hardware.

Result: C2|Q> achieved high completion rates (93.8% for Python and 100% for JSON inputs), successfully recommending appropriate hardware for up to 56 qubits and reducing developer effort by up to 40 times in case studies relative to manual SDK implementations. It enables practical execution of small to medium quantum tasks on NISQ hardware.

Conclusion: C2|Q> significantly lowers barriers for classical software engineers to develop quantum programs, streamlines the quantum workflow, improves productivity, and can automatically map classical specifications to quantum solutions across current quantum hardware.

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is emerging as a critical discipline to
make quantum computing accessible to a broader developer community; however,
most quantum development environments still require developers to engage with
low-level details across the software stack - including problem encoding,
circuit construction, algorithm configuration, hardware selection, and result
interpretation - making them difficult for classical software engineers to use.
To bridge this gap, we present C2|Q>: a hardware-agnostic quantum software
development framework that translates classical specifications (code) into
quantum-executable programs while preserving methodological rigor. The
framework applies modular software engineering principles by classifying the
workflow into three core modules: an encoder that classifies problems, produces
Quantum-Compatible Formats (QCFs), and constructs quantum circuits, a
deployment module that generates circuits and recommends hardware based on
fidelity, runtime, and cost, and a decoder that interprets quantum outputs into
classical solutions. In evaluation, the encoder module achieved a 93.8%
completion rate, the hardware recommendation module consistently selected the
appropriate quantum devices for workloads scaling up to 56 qubits, and the full
C2|Q>: workflow successfully processed classical specifications (434 Python
snippets and 100 JSON inputs) with completion rates of 93.8% and 100%,
respectively. For case study problems executed on publicly available NISQ
hardware, C2|Q>: reduced the required implementation effort by nearly 40X
compared to manual implementations using low-level quantum software development
kits (SDKs), with empirical runs limited to small- and medium-sized instances
consistent with current NISQ capabilities. The open-source implementation of
C2|Q>: is available at https://github.com/C2-Q/C2Q

### [13] [GramTrans: A Better Code Representation Approach in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02887)
*Zhao Zhang,Qingyuan Liang,Zeyu Sun,Yizhou Chen,Guoqing Wang,Yican Sun,Lu Zhang,Ge Li,Yingfei Xiong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Simpler parsing leads to better code generation: transforming code into easier-to-parse representations significantly boosts model performance, as demonstrated by the authors' GramTrans tool and comprehensive experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the lack of a principled understanding of how the choice of code representation impacts the performance of code generation models, specifically regarding the relationship between parsing difficulty and model effectiveness.

Method: The authors formalize the conjecture using grammar classes to measure parsing difficulty and perform controlled experiments using a Python-based DSL. They introduce GramTrans, a tool that automatically transforms context-free languages into LL(1) representations, employing a hierarchical conflict elimination algorithm. Evaluations were conducted on Python and Java code using three code generation models.

Result: GramTrans significantly improves model performance over baseline representations across several benchmarks for Python and Java code. The results show a strong correlation between easier-to-parse representations and higher model effectiveness. Analysis of other representations also supports their conjecture.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that parsing difficulty is strongly aligned with code generation model performance, and that transforming code into simpler grammar classes like LL(1) can enhance overall effectiveness. GramTrans provides a practical approach for achieving these improvements.

Abstract: Code generation has shown great promise in assisting software development. A
fundamental yet underexplored question is how the choice of code representation
affects model performance. While existing studies employ various
representations, such as treating code as plain text, grammar rule sequences,
or syntax tree sequences, they lack a principled understanding of the
relationship between parsing difficulty and model effectiveness. This paper
proposes a conjecture: the easier a representation is to parse, the better
performance the model achieves. We formalize this idea using grammar classes,
where representations in simpler classes (e.g., LL(1)) are easier to parse.
Through a controlled experiment on a Python-based DSL, we show that parsing
difficulty strongly correlates with model performance. Motivated by this
finding, we present GramTrans, a general approach that automatically transforms
a context-free language into a representation within the LL(1) class. GramTrans
introduces a novel hierarchical conflict elimination algorithm, enabling a
flexible trade-off between syntactic simplicity and token efficiency. We
evaluate GramTrans on both Python and Java using three code generation models:
StarCoder 1B, DeepSeek-Coder 1.3B, and Qwen2.5 1.5B. Across multiple
benchmarks, GramTrans consistently delivers significant improvements over
baseline representations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing representations
reconfirms the strong alignment between parsing difficulty and model
performance, providing additional support for the conjecture.

### [14] [Mechanistic Interpretability of Code Correctness in LLMs via Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02917)
*Kriz Tahimic,Charibeth Cheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper uses sparse autoencoders to uncover how LLMs internally process code correctness. Directions linked to correctness reliably forecast errors and correction, especially when more attention is paid to test cases than problem descriptions. These insights power strategies for better prompting, error alarms, and improved model steering, demonstrating that code awareness mechanisms learned in pre-training persist after fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software engineering, and their output often goes directly into production. Therefore, it is vital to understand how LLMs internally assess and ensure code correctness to enhance safety and reliability.

Method: The study applies sparse autoencoders to decompose LLM representations and identify directions associated with code correctness. These directions are selected using t-statistics and separation scores on base model representations. The authors further analyze these directions using techniques like steering, attention inspection, and weight orthogonalization to understand their mechanistic roles.

Result: The analysis reveals that certain directions in LLM representations consistently predict incorrect code. The models' ability to correct errors is statistically significant, but optimizing for both error correction and code preservation involves tradeoffs. Error correction often works best when the model attends to test cases instead of just problem descriptions. Directions identified during pre-training generally remain effective after fine-tuning (instruction-tuning).

Conclusion: Mechanistic insights from this approach lead to practical applications: (1) prompting should focus on providing test examples rather than verbose descriptions, (2) predictor directions may help serve as error alarms for developer oversight, and (3) selective steering should target anticipated errors to avoid negatively impacting correct code.

Abstract: As Large Language Models become integral to software development, with
substantial portions of AI-suggested code entering production, understanding
their internal correctness mechanisms becomes critical for safe deployment. We
apply sparse autoencoders to decompose LLM representations, identifying
directions that correspond to code correctness. We select predictor directions
using t-statistics and steering directions through separation scores from base
model representations, then analyze their mechanistic properties through
steering, attention analysis, and weight orthogonalization. We find that code
correctness directions in LLMs reliably predict incorrect code, while
correction capabilities, though statistically significant, involve tradeoffs
between fixing errors and preserving correct code. Mechanistically, successful
code generation depends on attending to test cases rather than problem
descriptions. Moreover, directions identified in base models retain their
effectiveness after instruction-tuning, suggesting code correctness mechanisms
learned during pre-training are repurposed during fine-tuning. Our mechanistic
insights suggest three practical applications: prompting strategies should
prioritize test examples over elaborate problem descriptions, predictor
directions can serve as error alarms for developer review, and these same
predictors can guide selective steering, intervening only when errors are
anticipated to prevent the code corruption from constant steering.

### [15] [Model-Agnostic Correctness Assessment for LLM-Generated Code via Dynamic Internal Representation Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02934)
*Thanh Trong Vu,Tuan-Dung Bui,Thu-Trang Nguyen,Son Nguyen,Hieu Dinh Vo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AUTOPROBE is a new attention-based, model-agnostic method for assessing LLM-generated code correctness by dynamically selecting informative internal signals. It robustly outperforms existing approaches in security, compilability, and functionality assessment across diverse models and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Though LLMs are powerful at generating code, ensuring the correctness (compilability, functionality, security) of their outputs remains challenging. Prior methods for correctness assessment use fixed model layer/position representations, which limits adaptability to different LLM architectures and tasks.

Method: AUTOPROBE is introduced as a model-agnostic, attention-based mechanism that dynamically selects the most informative hidden states from LLMs. It learns importance scores for representations, aggregates them, and uses a probing classifier to assess correctness across multiple dimensions.

Result: AUTOPROBE outperforms current baselines across code correctness benchmarks and LLMs. It achieves 18% better security assessment than the previous best white-box approach, shows up to 19% stronger compilability assessment, and provides up to 111% better functionality assessment, maintaining high robustness across code complexities.

Conclusion: The dynamic, attention-guided selection of internal signals in AUTOPROBE enables broad, robust, and generalizable assessment of code correctness from various LLMs, improving performance beyond static and fixed probing approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation and are increasingly integrated into the software development
process. However, ensuring the correctness of LLM-generated code remains a
critical concern. Prior work has shown that the internal representations of
LLMs encode meaningful signals for assessing code correctness. Nevertheless,
the existing methods rely on representations from pre-selected/fixed layers and
token positions, which could limit its generalizability across diverse model
architectures and tasks. In this work, we introduce AUTOPROBE, a novel
model-agnostic approach that dynamically selects the most informative internal
representations for code correctness assessment. AUTOPROBE employs an
attention-based mechanism to learn importance scores for hidden states,
enabling it to focus on the most relevant features. These weighted
representations are then aggregated and passed to a probing classifier to
predict code correctness across multiple dimensions, including compilability,
functionality, and security. To evaluate the performance of AUTOPROBE, we
conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and code LLMs. Our
experimental results show that AUTOPROBE consistently outperforms the
baselines. For security assessment, AUTOPROBE surpasses the state-of-the-art
white-box approach by 18%. For compilability and functionality assessment,
AUTOPROBE demonstrates its highest robustness to code complexity, with the
performance higher than the other approaches by up to 19% and 111%,
respectively. These findings highlight that dynamically selecting important
internal signals enables AUTOPROBE to serve as a robust and generalizable
solution for assessing the correctness of code generated by various LLMs.

### [16] [Tracing and Metrics Design Patterns for Monitoring Cloud-native Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02991)
*Carlos Albuquerque,Filipe F. Correia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Cloud-native apps face observability challenges due to fragmentation and complexity. This paper introduces three patterns—Distributed Tracing, Application Metrics, and Infrastructure Metrics—each improving reliability, diagnosing issues, and monitoring performance based on successful industry practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As cloud-native applications become more distributed and rapidly evolving, traditional observability methods struggle with fragmented monitoring and complicated root cause analysis.

Method: The paper builds on previous research and proposes three main design patterns—Distributed Tracing, Application Metrics, and Infrastructure Metrics—for monitoring cloud-native environments. These are distilled from industry practices and observability frameworks.

Result: The paper defines and illustrates three patterns: Distributed Tracing for analyzing request flows and latency, Application Metrics for structured performance monitoring and anomaly detection, and Infrastructure Metrics for understanding resource utilization and system health.

Conclusion: The introduction and description of these three observability patterns provides practical guidance for improving reliability and maintainability of cloud-native applications.

Abstract: Observability helps ensure the reliability and maintainability of
cloud-native applications. As software architectures become increasingly
distributed and subject to change, it becomes a greater challenge to diagnose
system issues effectively, often having to deal with fragmented observability
and more difficult root cause analysis. This paper builds upon our previous
work and introduces three design patterns that address key challenges in
monitoring cloud-native applications. Distributed Tracing improves visibility
into request flows across services, aiding in latency analysis and root cause
detection, Application Metrics provides a structured approach to instrumenting
applications with meaningful performance indicators, enabling real-time
monitoring and anomaly detection, and Infrastructure Metrics focuses on
monitoring the environment in which the system is operated, helping teams
assess resource utilization, scalability, and operational health. These
patterns are derived from industry practices and observability frameworks and
aim to offer guidance for software practitioners.

### [17] [Patterns for Teaching Agile with Student Projects -- Team and Project Setup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03005)
*Daniel Pinho,Petr Pícha,Filipe Correia,Přemek Brada*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Most literature on teaching Agile Software Development is too theoretical for direct classroom use. This paper presents practical, experience-based patterns for better team and project setups in ASD courses, offering more actionable guidance for educators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many higher education courses teach Agile Software Development (ASD), but much of the literature lacks actionable, practical guidance for classroom use, particularly for teaching ASD practices directly to university students.

Method: The authors draw from their own experience as educators to develop and present a pattern language—a structured approach—focused on the team and project setup phase for teaching ASD. They introduce five specific patterns as initial examples.

Result: Five patterns are identified and described to help set up teams and projects in ASD education: Capping Team Size, Smaller Project Scope, Business Non-Critical Project, Self-assembling Teams, and Team Chooses Topic. These are proposed as foundational elements for an overall pattern language for teaching ASD.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical, experience-based patterns as actionable advice for educators to use when teaching Agile Software Development, especially during the team and project setup phases. This work represents an initial effort toward a larger pattern language aimed at improving ASD education.

Abstract: Higher education courses teaching about agile software development (ASD) have
increased in commonality as the ideas behind the Agile Manifesto became more
commonplace in the industry. However, a lot of the literature on how ASD is
applied in the classroom does not provide much actionable advice, focusing on
frameworks or even moving beyond the software development area into teaching in
an agile way. We, therefore, showcase early work on a pattern language that
focuses on teaching ASD practices to university students, which stems from our
own experiences as educators in higher education contexts. We present five
patterns, specifically focused on team and project setup phase: Capping Team
Size, Smaller Project Scope, Business Non-Critical Project, Self-assembling
Teams, and Team Chooses Topic as a starting point for developing the overall
pattern language.

### [18] [Investigating The Smells of LLM Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03029)
*Debalina Ghosh Paul,Hong Zhu,Ian Bayley*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper systematically explores the code quality—specifically code smells—of Java programs generated by state-of-the-art LLMs compared to professional code. Code generated by LLMs shows substantially more quality issues, especially for complex tasks and advanced topics, although the trend mirrors human coding patterns. Falcon exhibited the least quality degradation among the tested models, but overall, machine-generated code remains inferior in quality to human-written code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While much research focuses on the functional correctness of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), there is comparatively little investigation into their code quality. This paper aims to fill that gap by systematically evaluating the code quality of LLM-generated programs.

Method: The authors present a scenario-based evaluation method, which measures code smells as an indicator of code quality. LLM outputs are compared to professionally written reference solutions. The dataset is divided by topic and coding complexity to test LLM performance across various scenarios. An automated test system is developed and experiments are conducted using Java code generated by four prominent LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon.

Result: LLM-generated code consistently shows a higher rate of code smells than professional reference solutions. Among tested models, Falcon exhibits the smallest increase in code smells (42.28%), followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%), and Codex (84.97%). On average, LLM-generated code shows a 63.34% increase in code smells, more pronounced in implementation (73.35%) than design (21.42%) categories. More complex and advanced coding scenarios further exacerbate quality issues.

Conclusion: LLMs' code quality, as measured by code smells, is closely tied to task complexity and topic, mirroring patterns seen in human-coded solutions. Nonetheless, the overall quality of LLM-generated code remains significantly lower than that of human-written code across all tested scenarios.

Abstract: Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate
program code. Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of
generated code, but there is far less on code quality.
  Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating
the quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which
the quality of LLM generated code should be improved.
  Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code
quality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of
professionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets
according to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to
represent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also
present an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with
the Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four
state-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon.
  Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code
smells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with
a smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%)
and finally Codex (84.97%). The average smell increase across all LLMs was
63.34%, comprising 73.35% for implementation smells and 21.42% for design
smells. We also found that the increase in code smells is greater for more
complex coding tasks and for more advanced topics, such as those involving
object-orientated concepts.
  Conclusion: In terms of code smells, LLM's performances on various coding
task complexities and topics are highly correlated to the quality of human
written code in the corresponding scenarios. However, the quality of LLM
generated code is noticeably poorer than human written code.

### [19] [Refactoring Towards Microservices: Preparing the Ground for Service Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03050)
*Rita Peixoto,Filipe F. Correia,Thatiane Rosa,Eduardo Guerra,Alfredo Goldman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper tackles the manual, code-level challenges of migrating from monoliths to microservices by presenting a structured catalogue of seven refactorings, making the process more systematic and easier for developers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many organizations want to migrate from monolithic systems to microservices to gain numerous advantages, but the migration is mostly manual and code-level challenges are under-addressed in literature.

Method: The authors introduce a catalogue of seven refactorings focused at the code-level, especially dealing with dependencies, consolidating approaches from previous literature and systematizing them for practical use.

Result: A systematic, step-by-step guide for code-level refactorings is presented, making the migration process more straightforward and paving the way for potential automation.

Conclusion: The work fills a critical gap by providing developers with practical tools for code-level migration to microservices, simplifying an otherwise labour-intensive process and fostering future automation.

Abstract: As organizations increasingly transition from monolithic systems to
microservices, they aim to achieve higher availability, automatic scaling,
simplified infrastructure management, enhanced collaboration, and streamlined
deployments. However, this migration process remains largely manual and
labour-intensive. While existing literature offers various strategies for
decomposing monoliths, these approaches primarily focus on architecture-level
guidance, often overlooking the code-level challenges and dependencies that
developers must address during the migration. This article introduces a
catalogue of seven refactorings specifically designed to support the transition
to a microservices architecture with a focus on handling dependencies. The
catalogue provides developers with a systematic guide that consolidates
refactorings identified in the literature and addresses the critical gap in
systematizing the process at the code level. By offering a structured,
step-by-step approach, this work simplifies the migration process and lays the
groundwork for its potential automation, empowering developers to implement
these changes efficiently and effectively.

### [20] [State Field Coverage: A Metric for Oracle Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03071)
*Facundo Molina,Nazareno Aguirre,Alessandra Gorla*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'state field coverage,' a new metric for evaluating software test oracles, showing it efficiently and reliably predicts oracles' ability to detect faults, thereby guiding improvements in software testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the crucial role of test oracles in determining software testing effectiveness, pointing out the limitations of current metrics for assessing oracle quality. Existing metrics either lack general applicability or fail to guide oracle improvement comprehensively.

Method: The authors propose 'state field coverage,' a new metric that measures how much of an object's state is examined by test oracles, based on statically defined class fields. They implement a static computation mechanism for this metric to make it efficient and actionable.

Result: Through extensive experiments with 273 representation invariants and over 249,000 test assertions, the paper demonstrates that state field coverage strongly correlates with fault detection capability, as measured by mutation score.

Conclusion: State field coverage is an effective and general metric for assessing and improving oracle quality, providing practical guidance on increasing the effectiveness of software testing.

Abstract: The effectiveness of testing in uncovering software defects depends not only
on the characteristics of the test inputs and how thoroughly they exercise the
software, but also on the quality of the oracles used to determine whether the
software behaves as expected. Therefore, assessing the quality of oracles is
crucial to improve the overall effectiveness of the testing process. Existing
metrics have been used for this purpose, but they either fail to provide a
comprehensive basis for guiding oracle improvement, or they are tailored to
specific types of oracles, thus limiting their generality.
  In this paper, we introduce state field coverage, a novel metric for
assessing oracle quality. This metric measures the proportion of an object's
state, as statically defined by its class fields, that an oracle may access
during test execution. The main intuition of our metric is that oracles with a
higher state field coverage are more likely to detect faults in the software
under analysis, as they inspect a larger portion of the object states to
determine whether tests pass or not.
  We implement a mechanism to statically compute the state field coverage
metric. Being statically computed, the metric is efficient and provides direct
guidance for improving test oracles by identifying state fields that remain
unexamined. We evaluate state field coverage through experiments involving 273
representation invariants and 249,027 test assertions. The results show that
state field coverage is a well-suited metric for assessing oracle quality, as
it strongly correlates with the oracles' fault-detection ability, measured by
mutation score.

### [21] [When Names Disappear: Revealing What LLMs Actually Understand About Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03178)
*Cuong Chi Le,Minh V. T. Pham,Cuong Duc Van,Hoang N. Phan,Huy N. Phan,Tien N. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs often rely on memorizing code naming conventions rather than true semantic understanding; a new obfuscation-based benchmark reveals these weaknesses and offers a more reliable assessment of LLMs' code reasoning skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate how large language models (LLMs) understand code, specifically whether their strong performance on code tasks is genuinely based on semantic reasoning or is driven by memorization of naming conventions. There is a need for benchmarks that accurately assess true code understanding without the confounding influence of human-interpretable names.

Method: The paper analyzes the effects of removing human-interpretable naming from code, applying semantics-preserving obfuscations, and measuring performance of LLMs on both summarization (intent-level) and execution (structural) tasks. The study introduces ClassEval-Obf, a benchmark that obfuscates naming cues while preserving the underlying program behavior.

Result: The results show that removing naming significantly degrades model performance, even on execution tasks that should depend only on structural semantics. This finding suggests current benchmarks may overstate LLMs' code understanding due to memorization of naming patterns. The obfuscation-enhanced benchmark ClassEval-Obf reduces these inflated gaps and exposes how much models rely on superficial naming cues.

Conclusion: The study concludes that existing LLM benchmarks are susceptible to identifier leakage and memorization shortcuts. ClassEval-Obf provides a more accurate measure of LLMs' true code understanding and promotes generalization rather than memorization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how
they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates
through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and
human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel
severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models
regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent
reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing
that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than
genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite
of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier
leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we
release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically
suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that
ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization
shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code
understanding and generalization.

### [22] [Abstain and Validate: A Dual-LLM Policy for Reducing Noise in Agentic Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03217)
*José Cambronero,Michele Tufano,Sherry Shi,Renyao Wei,Grant Uy,Runxiang Cheng,Chin-Jung Liu,Shiying Pan,Satish Chandra,Pat Rondon*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Introducing LLM-based bug abstention and patch validation policies greatly reduces noise and increases the success rate of automated program repair systems, making them more suitable for large-scale industrial deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated Program Repair (APR) systems are advancing to resolve complex bugs in industrial codebases, but their outputs often require manual review due to the risk of proposing ineffective or spurious patches. Excessive noise from unlikely patches can waste developer time and diminish trust in automation.

Method: The paper introduces two LLM-based (Large Language Model) policies: bug abstention, which filters out bugs unlikely to be fixed by the APR system, and patch validation, which rejects patches that are unlikely to effectively resolve a given bug. Both methods are evaluated on various bug datasets from Google's codebase, using patches generated by an internal APR system.

Result: Implementing bug abstention and patch validation individually can increase successful patch rates by up to 13 and 15 percentage points, respectively, and up to 39 percentage points when combined. The patch validation policy also improves results for machine-generated bug reports (e.g., null pointer exceptions and sanitizer reports).

Conclusion: The combination of bug abstention and patch validation policies significantly improves the reliability and practicality of agentic APR systems for industrial use. This approach facilitates more trusted, scalable deployment of automated patch generation.

Abstract: Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex,
repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still
need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address
the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise,
wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We
introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug
abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the
agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that
are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on
three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches
generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported
bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise
success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points,
respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer
exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports,
patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This
two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale
deployment of agentic APR systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relational programming languages like miniKanren have great expressive power but suffer from practical challenges when building real-world applications, such as usability, debugging, and integration with host languages.

Method: Walrus is implemented as an embedded language in Haskell, extending miniKanren with features like type-polymorphic unification, structured debugging, on-demand laziness, use of Haskell Generics, and product type support.

Result: Walrus demonstrates enhanced practical usability in developing bidirectional compilers and offers improvements including better type handling, boilerplate reduction, debugging, and ergonomic support for data structures.

Conclusion: Walrus improves the miniKanren relational programming paradigm with type safety, usability enhancements, and practical debugging, making it more viable for real-world software development.

Abstract: We present Walrus, a functional relational programming language embedded in
Haskell that extends the miniKanren model with type-polymorphic unification,
on-demand laziness, and a range of usability features aimed at practical
development. These include use of Haskell Generics for boilerplate reduction,
structured debugging traces, and ergonomic support for product types. We

decisions and recurring usability challenges encountered in practice.

### [24] [Beyond Cons: Purely Relational Data Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03170)
*Rafaello Sanna,William E. Byrd,Nada Amin*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Kanren extends miniKanren with powerful and expressive constraints for sets and association lists, enabling better abstract data manipulation without the need for complex encodings or inefficient searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning about collections such as sets and association lists declaratively is challenging and often requires cumbersome structural encodings or inefficient representation searches. There was a need for more expressive and operationally efficient support for these data structures in logic programming systems like miniKanren.

Method: The authors developed Kanren as an extension to miniKanren, adding first-class support for sets and association lists along with a complete family of set-theoretic constraints and scoped lookup. They describe its design, implementation, and give representative examples to showcase its utility.

Result: Kanren allows for declarative and lazy manipulation of sets and association lists, supports set equality based on contents, enables finite failure, and delivers improved expressiveness and behavior for programs that manipulate abstract data.

Conclusion: Kanren significantly enhances miniKanren's capabilities for abstract data manipulation, particularly in writing interpreters, by enabling expressive, declarative, and efficient reasoning about sets and association lists.

Abstract: We present {Kanren} (read: set-Kanren), an extension to miniKanren with
constraints for reasoning about sets and association lists. {Kanren} includes
first-class set objects, a functionally complete family of set-theoretic
constraints (including membership, union, and disjointedness), and new
constraints for reasoning about association lists with shadowing and scoped
lookup. These additions allow programmers to describe collections declaratively
and lazily, without relying on structural encodings and eager search over
representation spaces. The result is improved expressiveness and operational
behavior in programs that manipulate abstract data -- particularly interpreters
