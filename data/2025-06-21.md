### [1] [OS-Harm: A Benchmark for Measuring Safety of Computer Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14866)
*Thomas Kuntz,Agatha Duzan,Hao Zhao,Francesco Croce,Zico Kolter,Nicolas Flammarion,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces OS-Harm, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing the safety of LLM-based computer use agents, revealing that current models have significant vulnerabilities to misuse and prompt injection attacks. The benchmark and evaluation code are open-sourced to facilitate community progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer use agents, powered by large language models (LLMs) and capable of directly interacting with graphical user interfaces, are becoming more widespread. However, the safety issues of these agents, especially their susceptibility to harmful behaviors and attacks, have not been thoroughly examined. Addressing this gap is crucial for safe and responsible deployment.

Method: The authors introduce OS-Harm, a novel benchmark built upon the OSWorld environment to test the safety of computer use agents. OS-Harm includes 150 tasks across diverse OS applications and measures three key categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. An automated judge is proposed to evaluate agent actions for both accuracy and safety, with performance validated against human annotations.

Result: Findings show that all tested frontier models (o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) tend to comply with misuse-based instructions, are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, and sometimes display unsafe behaviors. The automated judge correlates well with human evaluations, with F1 scores of 0.76 and 0.79. OS-Harm provides actionable insights into the safety limitations of current computer use agents.

Conclusion: OS-Harm provides a standardized, rigorous framework for assessing the safety of LLM-based computer use agents. Current models exhibit notable weaknesses in handling harmful interactions, highlighting the urgent need for improved safety measures. The benchmark and evaluation tools are publicly available to stimulate further research and development in this area.

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a
graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees.
While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely
overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential
for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap,
we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use
agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test
models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt
injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150
tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright
infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to
interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,
etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and
safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and
0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier
models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide
insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply
with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt
injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is
available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/os-harm.

### [2] [An Empirical Study of Bugs in Data Visualization Libraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15084)
*Weiqi Lu,Yongqiang Tian,Xiaohan Zhong,Haoyang Ma,Zhenyang Xu,Shing-Chi Cheung,Chengnian Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper delivers the first large-scale analysis of bugs in data visualization libraries, outlines their prevalent causes, suggests new testing strategies, and evaluates current AI-based bug detection approaches, emphasizing the need for tailored automated testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data visualization libraries are essential for accurately representing data for analysis and decision-making. However, visual bugs can mislead users and have significant negative implications, unlike traditional software bugs that cause crashes. Understanding such bugs is crucial to help researchers and developers improve the reliability of these libraries.

Method: The study conducted a comprehensive analysis of 564 bugs across five widely-used DataViz libraries. They systematically categorized the symptoms and root causes of these bugs and created a detailed taxonomy. The analysis also identified key steps and test oracles for triggering and detecting such bugs. Additionally, the effectiveness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for automated plot bug detection was evaluated.

Result: The study found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are common in DataViz libraries, with incorrect graphic computation being the primary root cause. Eight steps to trigger these bugs and two specific test oracles were identified. When applying VLMs to detect inaccurate plots, detection effectiveness varied between 29% and 57%, and more detailed prompts did not always improve performance.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for more targeted and automated testing mechanisms in DataViz libraries to address pervasive bugs. The taxonomy, key bug-triggering steps, and test oracles provided by this study offer a foundation for developing better testing techniques. The potential and limitations of VLMs for supporting bug detection in this domain were also demonstrated.

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our
manuscript.

### [3] [Program Feature-based Fuzzing Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15088)
*Miao Miao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a new benchmark that allows fine-grained analysis of how specific program features affect fuzzing effectiveness, showing that different fuzzers perform variably depending on these features, suggesting the need for more nuanced benchmarks in future evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fuzzing benchmarks do not adequately consider how specific, fine-grained program features affect a fuzzer's effectiveness, potentially missing important insights into fuzzer performance.

Method: The authors reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing studies to identify 7 key program features related to control-flow and data-flow. They used these features to generate a benchmark of 153 programs, each with 10 configurable parameters, and evaluated the performance of 11 popular fuzzers on this benchmark.

Result: Fuzzer performance differs significantly depending on specific program features and their individual strengths.

Conclusion: Program characteristics meaningfully impact fuzzing effectiveness. Future fuzzing evaluations should incorporate fine-grained program features for more insightful analysis.

Abstract: Fuzzing is a powerful software testing technique renowned for its
effectiveness in identifying software vulnerabilities. Traditional fuzzing
evaluations typically focus on overall fuzzer performance across a set of
target programs, yet few benchmarks consider how fine-grained program features
influence fuzzing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
benchmark designed to generate programs with configurable, fine-grained program
features to enhance fuzzing evaluations. We reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing
studies, extracting 7 program features related to control-flow and data-flow
that can impact fuzzer performance. Using these features, we generated a
benchmark consisting of 153 programs controlled by 10 fine-grained configurable
parameters. We evaluated 11 popular fuzzers using this benchmark. The results
indicate that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on the program
features and their strengths, highlighting the importance of incorporating
program characteristics into fuzzing evaluations.

### [4] [Enhancement Report Approval Prediction: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15098)
*Haosheng Zuo,Feifei Niu,Chuanyi Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) significantly outperform older machine learning and deep learning approaches in automated enhancement report approval prediction, especially when creator profiles and fine-tuning are used. LLMs offer a 5% accuracy improvement, better recall, and improved handling of class imbalance, paving the way for more efficient software maintenance. The paper also notes some areas where LLMs need further improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual processing of enhancement reports (ERs) is time-consuming and may delay or lose valuable software improvement suggestions, motivating the need for automated methods to improve efficiency and accuracy in ER approval prediction.

Method: The study systematically evaluates 18 large language model (LLM) variants—including encoder models like BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3, ELECTRA, XLNet and decoder models like GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, DeepSeek-V3—against traditional methods such as CNN/LSTM-BERT/GloVe for ER approval prediction. The evaluation also explores the impact of incorporating creator profiles and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Adding creator profiles increases the accuracy of unfine-tuned decoder-only LLMs by 10.8% but may introduce bias. The LoRA fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model achieves 79% accuracy and significantly boosts recall for approved reports (76.1% vs. 64.1% with LSTM-GLOVE), outperforming traditional methods by 5% under strict, chronological evaluation. The approach also better addresses class imbalance issues.

Conclusion: LLMs, especially those with fine-tuning and profile incorporation, surpass traditional methods in ER approval prediction, streamlining software maintenance and decision-making. The study also points out cases where large models underperform, suggesting directions for future research.

Abstract: Enhancement reports (ERs) serve as a critical communication channel between
users and developers, capturing valuable suggestions for software improvement.
However, manually processing these reports is resource-intensive, leading to
delays and potential loss of valuable insights. To address this challenge,
enhancement report approval prediction (ERAP) has emerged as a research focus,
leveraging machine learning techniques to automate decision-making. While
traditional approaches have employed feature-based classifiers and deep
learning models, recent advancements in large language models (LLM) present new
opportunities for enhancing prediction accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates 18 LLM variants (including BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3, ELECTRA, and
XLNet for encoder models; GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.1
8B Instruct and DeepSeek-V3 for decoder models) against traditional methods
(CNN/LSTM-BERT/GloVe). Our experiments reveal two key insights: (1)
Incorporating creator profiles increases unfine-tuned decoder-only models'
overall accuracy by 10.8 percent though it may introduce bias; (2) LoRA
fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B Instruct further improve performance, reaching 79
percent accuracy and significantly enhancing recall for approved reports (76.1
percent vs. LSTM-GLOVE's 64.1 percent), outperforming traditional methods by 5
percent under strict chronological evaluation and effectively addressing class
imbalance issues. These findings establish LLM as a superior solution for ERAP,
demonstrating their potential to streamline software maintenance workflows and
improve decision-making in real-world development environments. We also
investigated and summarized the ER cases where the large models underperformed,
providing valuable directions for future research.

### [5] [Towards Bug-Free Distributed Go Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15135)
*Zhengqun Koo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a static verification framework for Go-based distributed systems to prove the absence of communication races, helping developers avoid hard-to-find concurrency bugs in message-passing programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning about concurrency in distributed systems is difficult for programmers, often resulting in unexpected race conditions (bugs), especially in message-passing systems like those using Go channels.

Method: The paper introduces a static verification framework that analyzes distributed programs written in a subset of Go, using an extended happens-before order to reason about program execution with both buffered and unbuffered channels.

Result: The proposed framework can statically prove the absence of communication races in distributed programs using message passing, increasing the reliability of such programs.

Conclusion: The authors present an effective static analysis method to verify communication-race-freedom in distributed Go programs, filling a gap left by prior work mainly focused on data races in shared memory systems.

Abstract: Programmers of distributed systems need to reason about concurrency to avoid
races. However, reasoning about concurrency is difficult, and unexpected races
show up as bugs. Data race detection in shared memory systems is well-studied
(dynamic data race detection [13], behavioral types [15], dynamic race
detection [31]). Similar to how a data race consists of reads and writes not
related by happens-before at a shared memory location, a communication race
consists of receives and sends not related by happens-before on a shared
channel. Communication races are problematic: a receiver expects a specific
message from a specific sender, but with a communication race, the receiver can
receive a message meant for another receiver, or not receive anything at all.
In this work, we describe a verification framework that can prove the absence
of communication races for distributed programs that use a subset of the Go
programming language, where synchronization is mainly achieved via message
passing. We statically reason about how a distributed program executes, using a
happens-before order, extended to buffered and unbuffered channels.

### [7] [A Novel Compiler Transformation for Fast Sparse Matrix Multiplication in GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15174)
*Hossein Albakri,Kazem Cheshmi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: A novel compiler technique accelerates sparse neural network computations on GPUs, yielding up to 2.27x speedup by optimizing memory and compute utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse data structures are widely used in neural networks to save memory, but cause irregular memory accesses, resulting in inefficient use of GPU resources and slowdowns.

Method: The paper introduces a compiler transformation called enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen, which boosts sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) efficiency on GPUs by enhancing data reuse and balancing workloads.

Result: Their method, when applied to sparse neural networks (including convolutional and transformer models) on an A100 GPU, achieves a geometric mean speedup of 1.84x to 2.27x over standard cuBLAS and cuSPARSE baselines across various configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed compiler transformation significantly improves the computational and memory efficiency of SPMM on GPUs, facilitating faster execution of sparse neural networks by addressing key performance bottlenecks.

Abstract: Sparse data structures are commonly used in neural networks to reduce the
memory footprint. These data structures are compact but cause irregularities
such as random memory accesses, which prevent efficient use of the memory
hierarchy. GPUs are a common platform for machine learning practitioners, but
running compact data structures on these devices often leads to slow-downs due
to inefficient use of computing and memory resources. This paper proposes a new
compiler transformation, enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen, that accelerates sparse
matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) on GPU devices. The transformation
increases data reuse in registers and caches while creating more balanced
workloads for GPU computing resources. The transformation is tested on sparse
neural networks in convolutional and transformer models. On an A100 GPU and
across a columns of matrix B (bCols) in $ A \times B = C$ from range of 32 to
128, the transformation yields a geometric mean speedup of 1.84$\times$ to
2.27$\times$ compared to cuBLAS and cuSPARSE baselines, respectively.

### [8] [PSM: Policy Synchronised Deterministic Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15424)
*Michael Mendler,Marc Pouzet*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSM, a new Haskell context that enables concurrent, deterministic, and race-free programming with shared, imperative memory — something not previously available with existing abstractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concurrency and determinacy often conflict when shared resources are involved. Existing Haskell abstractions either sacrifice determinacy for destructive updates or vice versa, and higher-level memory abstractions are needed to accommodate concurrent and determinate patterns.

Method: The authors introduce a new type context called PSM (policy synchronised memory) in Haskell, which combines features of existing monads. PSM enables computations with persistent state, imperative updates, concurrent threads, and shared state. Accesses are coordinated by policies to guarantee determinacy and race-free execution.

Result: Well-typed transactions in the PSM context allow for abstract data structures that are concurrently shareable, imperative, and behave deterministically. This provides a new way to write concurrent Haskell programs that do not sacrifice determinacy or allow race conditions.

Conclusion: The PSM context is a significant step towards supporting concurrent and determinate programming patterns in Haskell, offering imperative style, shared memory, and race-free determinacy, which overcomes the limitations of current abstractions.

Abstract: Concurrency and determinacy do not go well with each other when resources
must be shared. Haskell provides parallel programming abstractions such as IVar
and LVar in the Par monad and concurrent abstractions such as MVar and TVar in
the in IO and STM monads, respectively. The former are determinate but have no
destructive updates and the latter have destructive updates but do not
guarantee determinacy. Programming patterns that are both concurrent and
determinate, such as those provided by Kahn or Berry require memory
abstractions at a higher level than is currently available. In this paper we
describe a new type context PSM for policy synchronised memory in Haskell. Like
STM and IO, the computations in PSM can access persistent state and, as a
side-effect, update the memory in imperative style. Like the Par and IO monads,
PSM supports concurrent threads and shared state. However, in contrast to IO,
our PSM contexts are race-free since concurrent accesses are policy coordinated
which guarantees determinacy.Well-typed transactions in the PSM context can
accommodate abstract data structures that are imperative, concurrently
shareable and still behave deterministically, by construction.
