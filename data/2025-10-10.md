### [1] [Modeling Developer Burnout with GenAI Adoption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07435)
*Zixuan Feng,Sadia Afroz,Anita Sarma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GenAI adoption in software development increases burnout by raising job demands, but adequate support and positive perceptions can help turn this challenge into an opportunity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI is transforming software development workflows, but concerns have arisen about its impact on developer well-being, particularly burnout. The paper seeks to understand the relationship between GenAI adoption and burnout.

Method: The study uses the Job Demands–Resources (JD–R) model and employs a concurrent embedded mixed-methods research design. It combines quantitative (survey of 442 developers, PLS-SEM, and regression analysis) and qualitative (open-ended responses) evidence.

Result: The adoption of GenAI increases burnout among developers mainly by raising job demands. However, sufficient job resources and positive attitudes towards GenAI can mitigate these negative effects and help reframe adoption as beneficial.

Conclusion: While GenAI can lead to increased burnout due to heightened job demands, organizations and individuals can reduce its negative impact by enhancing job resources and fostering positive perceptions of GenAI adoption.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping software development workflows.
While prior studies emphasize productivity gains, the adoption of GenAI also
introduces new pressures that may harm developers' well-being. In this paper,
we investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers'
burnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic
lens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods
research design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first
surveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of
experience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation
Modeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands,
job resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of
open-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results
show that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job
resources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing
adoption as an opportunity.

### [2] [HotBugs.jar: A Benchmark of Hot Fixes for Time-Critical Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07529)
*Carol Hanna,Federica Sarro,Mark Harman,Justyna Petke*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces HotBugs.jar: the first comprehensive, manually validated, and reproducible dataset specifically for real-world software hot fixes, facilitating research and evaluation of rapid debugging and repair tools in modern production systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hot fixes are crucial for addressing urgent, high-priority issues in production systems, yet there has been no dedicated evaluation benchmark or dataset specifically for hot fixes in software engineering research. The lack of such resources hinders the development and assessment of debugging and automated repair tools in these scenarios.

Method: The authors mined 10 active Apache projects, analyzing over 190,000 commits and 150,000 issue reports. They systematically filtered and manually evaluated software patches based on specific hot-fix criteria, using Jira issue data. Independent reviewers validated the patches. The confirmed hot fixes were then packaged in a reproducible format—including buggy and fixed code, test suites, and extensive metadata—based on the Bugs.jar framework.

Result: From the data mining and manual validation process, 746 candidate hot fixes were identified, and 679 were confirmed as genuine. Out of these, 110 are reproducible with available test suites. The dataset, called HotBugs.jar, contains both the 110 reproducible and all 679 validated hot fixes, with comprehensive metadata to assist future research. The dataset has already seen adoption in a major conference challenge track.

Conclusion: HotBugs.jar is the first rigorous, reproducible, and metadata-rich benchmark dedicated to hot fixes in software, filling a critical gap in the research community. It enables systematic evaluation of tools targeting urgent production fixes, fostering advancement in automated repair and resilience of software systems.

Abstract: Hot fixes are urgent, unplanned changes deployed to production systems to
address time-critical issues. Despite their importance, no existing evaluation
benchmark focuses specifically on hot fixes. We present HotBugs$.$jar, the
first dataset dedicated to real-world hot fixes. From an initial mining of 10
active Apache projects totaling over 190K commits and 150K issue reports, we
identified 746 software patches that met our hot-fix criteria. After manual
evaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are
reproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework,
HotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all
679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to
support future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira
issue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible
format with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata. HotBugs$.$jar
has already been adopted as the official challenge dataset for the Search-Based
Software Engineering (SBSE) Conference Challenge Track, demonstrating its
immediate impact. This benchmark enables the study and evaluation of tools for
rapid debugging, automated repair, and production-grade resilience in modern
software systems to drive research in this essential area forward.

### [3] [RustAssure: Differential Symbolic Testing for LLM-Transpiled C-to-Rust Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07604)
*Yubo Bai,Tapti Palit*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RustAssure leverages LLMs and advanced testing to automatically convert C code to safe Rust, achieving high compilation and semantic equivalence rates in real applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rust is recognized for its memory safety, which is vital for software security. Many legacy codebases are written in memory-unsafe languages such as C. Efficiently and safely migrating these codebases to Rust is a significant challenge, requiring automation to harness Rust's benefits at scale.

Method: RustAssure uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic transpilation of C code to Rust, applying prompt engineering to guide the LLM toward generating idiomatic and safe Rust code. To ensure correctness beyond what basic tests provide, it employs differential symbolic testing to compare the semantic equivalence of the input C code and the generated Rust code.

Result: RustAssure was tested on five real-world applications and libraries. It successfully generated compilable Rust functions from 89.8% of C functions. Out of these, 69.9% of the functions produced symbolically identical return values when comparing the original C function with its Rust counterpart.

Conclusion: RustAssure demonstrates the potential of LLMs in automating the migration from C to Rust, generating mostly correct and safe Rust code while identifying the limitations and areas where semantics may diverge, thus enhancing software security through systematic translation and verification.

Abstract: Rust is a memory-safe programming language that significantly improves
software security. Existing codebases written in unsafe memory languages, such
as C, must first be transpiled to Rust to take advantage of Rust's improved
safety guarantees. RustAssure presents a system that uses Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automatically transpile existing C codebases to Rust. RustAssure uses
prompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating
idiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with
subtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing,
RustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic
similarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated
RustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our
system is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C
functions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both
the C and Rust functions.

### [4] [AppForge: From Assistant to Independent Developer -- Are GPTs Ready for Software Development?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07740)
*Dezhi Ran,Yuan Cao,Mengzhou Wu,Simin Chen,Yuzhe Guo,Jun Ren,Zihe Song,Hao Yu,Jialei Wei,Linyi Li,Wei Yang,Baishakhi Ray,Tao Xie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APPFORGE is a new, rigorous benchmark for assessing whether LLMs can create whole Android apps from scratch based on natural language specs. Tests of 12 leading models show all perform poorly, indicating major challenges for LLMs in real-world software engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large language models have excelled at function-level code generation, real-world software engineering tasks require reasoning and coordination at the application level. There is currently no suitable benchmark to evaluate whether LLMs can create full software systems from scratch.

Method: The authors introduce APPFORGE, a benchmark composed of 101 software development problems based on real-world Android applications. They use a multi-agent system to extract functionalities from documentation and generate tests for validating implementations. Manual expert vetting ensures the quality of the benchmark, which includes automated evaluation to make assessments reproducible and scalable.

Result: All 12 LLMs tested, including top models such as GPT-5, performed poorly, with the highest rate of correct full application implementation at only 18.8%. This reveals significant limitations in current LLMs' abilities to handle complex, multi-component software engineering tasks.

Conclusion: Current large language models are far from sufficient in generating robust, functionally correct, real-world software applications, particularly when complex component interaction, state management, and lifecycle control are required. APPFORGE provides a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and improving LLMs on these holistic software engineering challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in
function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world
applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must
orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across
states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the
lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately
evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software
systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark
consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android
apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a
language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android
app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding
and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,
calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To
construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize
the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize
test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.
Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE
incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that
enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily
adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all
evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model
(GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting
fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex,
multi-component software engineering challenges.

### [5] [Interleaved Learning and Exploration: A Self-Adaptive Fuzz Testing Framework for MLIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07815)
*Zeyu Sun,Jingjing Liang,Weiyi Wang,Chenyao Suo,Junjie Chen,Fanjiang Xu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FLEX is a new self-adaptive fuzzing tool for MLIR that uses neural networks and feedback loops to learn and generate diverse, valid test cases. It dramatically outperforms current fuzzers in both bug discovery and code coverage, proving to be a significant advancement for MLIR robustness testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the correctness and robustness of MLIR, a foundational technology for compiler frameworks, is challenging due to the limitations of existing fuzzing approaches that fail to effectively generate diverse and semantically valid test cases.

Method: The authors introduce FLEX, a self-adaptive fuzzing framework that uses neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy for diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop to iteratively refine its model based on collected test cases.

Result: FLEX outperforms four state-of-the-art fuzzers on the upstream MLIR compiler, discovering 80 previously unknown bugs in a 30-day campaign and 53 bugs in 24-hour fixed-revision tests (over 3.5 times more than the best baseline), and achieving 28.2% code coverage, 42% higher than the next-best tool. Ablation studies highlight the importance of perturbed generation and diversity augmentation.

Conclusion: FLEX effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional MLIR fuzzing by autonomously generating high-quality, diverse, and valid test cases, leading to superior bug discovery and code coverage.

Abstract: MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) has rapidly become a
foundational technology for modern compiler frameworks, enabling extensibility
across diverse domains. However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of
MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually
crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently
diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle
or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this
paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX
leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy
to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that
iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases.
Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and
semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX
on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a
30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple
new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it
detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2%
code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies
further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity
augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.

### [6] [Bug Histories as Sources of Compiler Fuzzing Mutators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07834)
*Lingjun Liu,Feiran Qin,Owolabi Legunsen,Marcelo d'Amorim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents IssueMut, the first system to extract compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. By mining 587 mutators from 1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports and integrating them into fuzzers, IssueMut uncovered dozens of unique bugs missed by mainstream fuzzers, with 60 confirmed or fixed, demonstrating that bug reports are highly valuable for guiding future compiler fuzzing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compiler bugs can cause serious issues in infrastructure, and finding these bugs is vital. While mutational fuzzers help by generating varied inputs, their effectiveness is limited by the sophistication of their mutators. Previous research hasn't exploited compiler bug histories as a source for new mutators.

Method: The authors propose IssueMut, an automated approach to mine mutators directly from compiler bug reports. These mutators are then integrated into existing mutational fuzzers. They extracted 587 mutators from 1760 bug reports for both GCC and LLVM compilers and tested them by running IssueMut-enhanced fuzzers on seed test corpora.

Result: IssueMut-derived mutators were able to find 28 new bugs in GCC and 37 in LLVM that were missed by state-of-the-art fuzzers. 60 of these bugs were confirmed or fixed, demonstrating the value of mining bug reports for mutators.

Conclusion: Bug histories are a rich and largely untapped source of knowledge for improving compiler fuzzers. The automatic mining of mutators from bug reports significantly enhances bug-finding capabilities, as validated by the discovery and confirmation of new bugs.

Abstract: Bugs in compilers, which are critical infrastructure today, can have outsized
negative impacts. Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by
systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness
depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler
bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach
for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is
that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler
bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated
method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into
existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from
1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with
all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that "bug history" mutators are
effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler
fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed,
validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler
fuzzers should leverage.

### [7] [An AUTOSAR-Aligned Architectural Study of Vulnerabilities in Automotive SoC Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07941)
*Srijita Basu,Haraldsson Bengt,Miroslaw Staron,Christian Berger,Jennifer Horkoff,Magnus Almgren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Security vulnerabilities in automotive SoC platforms, especially within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures, are systematically analyzed by mapping 180 reported cases. The study identifies key problems, root causes, affected modules, and delays in patching, offering practical strategies to strengthen security in modern vehicle systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity and integration of Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) systems based on System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures in the automotive sector has led to rising security concerns, especially given recent vulnerabilities and lack of systematic analysis within AUTOSAR-aligned designs.

Method: The study systematically analyzes 180 publicly reported SoC vulnerabilities in automotive contexts, mapping each to a representative AUTOSAR-aligned SoC software architecture. The analysis involves identifying root causes, affected modules, and examining patch/mitigation delays across different CWE categories and architecture layers.

Result: The authors identify 16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, revealing dominant vulnerability patterns and problematic modules with extended patch delays. They also uncover trends in mitigation timelines by mapping issues to architectural and CWE categories.

Conclusion: This paper provides actionable recommendations for improving detection, prioritization, and localization of vulnerabilities in SoC-based automotive platforms. The insights help guide developers and integrators towards more robust security practices in CCAM-focused CPS.

Abstract: Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) are complex
cyber-physical systems (CPS) that integrate computation, communication, and
control in safety-critical environments. At their core, System-on-Chip (SoC)
platforms consolidate processing units, communication interfaces, AI
accelerators, and security modules into a single chip. AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open
System ARchitecture) standard was developed in the automotive domain to better
manage this complexity, defining layered software structures and interfaces to
facilitate reuse of HW/SW components. However, in practice, this integrated SoC
software architecture still poses security challenges, particularly in
real-time, safety-critical environments. Recent reports highlight a surge in
SoC-related vulnerabilities, yet systematic analysis of their root causes and
impact within AUTOSAR-aligned architectures is lacking. This study fills that
gap by analyzing 180 publicly reported automotive SoC vulnerabilities, mapped
to a representative SoC software architecture model that is aligned with
AUTOSAR principles for layered abstraction and service orientation. We identify
16 root causes and 56 affected software modules, and examine mitigation delays
across Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories and architectural layers.
We uncover dominant vulnerability patterns and critical modules with prolonged
patch delays, and provide actionable insights for securing automotive CPS
platforms, including guides for improved detection, prioritization, and
localization strategies for SoC software architectures in SoC-based vehicle
platforms.

### [8] [Past, Present, and Future of Bug Tracking in the Generative AI Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08005)
*Utku Boran Torun,Mehmet Taha Demircan,Mahmut Furkan Gön,Eray Tüzün*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Manual bug tracking is slow due to coordination gaps and delays. This paper proposes an AI framework using LLMs to automate bug handling steps, reduce human effort, and offer quicker, more accurate fixes—ultimately speeding up software maintenance and user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bug tracking systems are currently slow and inefficient due to heavy reliance on manual processes and poor communication between users and technical teams, leading to delays and frustration.

Method: The paper proposes an AI-powered bug tracking framework that integrates large language model-driven automation into existing tools. The framework enables users to report issues in natural language and uses AI to refine, reproduce, classify, and triage bugs. LLMs help generate candidate patches, with human oversight to ensure correctness.

Result: The framework streamlines bug reporting, reduces human overhead, automates each phase from reporting to patch generation, accelerates response times, and improves collaboration between end users and developers.

Conclusion: Integrating intelligent automation into bug tracking systems significantly improves efficiency, reduces delays, enhances collaboration, and leads to a more user-centric and robust software maintenance process.

Abstract: Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting,
reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different
stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This
division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the
communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the
process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly
asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying
fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug
tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS
platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking
framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model
(LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing
time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural
language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request
missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through
no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also
generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By
integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response
times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices
for a more efficient, user-centric future.

### [9] [Building Whitespace-Sensitive Languages Using Whitespace-Insensitive Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08200)
*Alexander Hellwig,Nico Jansen,Bernhard Rumpe*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pre-processing approach that allows modular, whitespace-insensitive language components to be reused for building whitespace-sensitive languages, validated by reconstructing a simplified Python, thus improving reusability and efficiency in language engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for reusability in Software Language Engineering through composable modular language components. However, this is hindered by difficulties in integrating whitespace-sensitive and whitespace-insensitive languages, which limits the reuse of libraries and necessitates developing whitespace-sensitive languages from scratch.

Method: The paper proposes a technique that involves pre-processing language artifacts before parsing, allowing modular, whitespace-insensitive language modules to be used in constructing whitespace-sensitive languages.

Result: The approach was evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of Python, demonstrating increased reusability of existing language components.

Conclusion: The presented technique can bridge the gap between whitespace-sensitive and -insensitive language modules, thus improving reusability, reducing development time, and enhancing the quality of software languages.

Abstract: In Software Language Engineering, there is a trend towards reusability by
composing modular language components. However, this reusability is severely
inhibited by a gap in integrating whitespace-sensitive and
whitespace-insensitive languages. There is currently no consistent procedure
for seamlessly reusing such language components in both cases, such that
libraries often cannot be reused, and whitespacesensitive languages are
developed from scratch. This paper presents a technique for using modular,
whitespaceinsensitive language modules to construct whitespace sensitive
languages by pre-processing language artifacts before parsing. The approach is
evaluated by reconstructing a simplified version of the programming language
Python. Our solution aims to increase the reusability of existing language
components to reduce development time and increase the overall quality of
software languages.

### [10] [Type, Ability, and Effect Systems: Perspectives on Purity, Semantics, and Expressiveness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07582)
*Yuyan Bao,Tiark Rompf*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic foundation for reasoning about purity in effectful programming, a new way to measure how expressive effect systems are, finds that minimal capability and effect systems are not directly comparable, and proposes a unified model that combines their advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programming paradigms strive to clearly distinguish pure computation from effectful interactions, but existing mechanisms (monads, type-and-effect systems, capabilities) have trade-offs between precision and usability. This creates a need for more precise assessment tools for such systems.

Method: The paper first introduces a semantic, system-agnostic definition of purity based on contextual equivalence. It then develops a new criterion for expressiveness (degree of completeness) and applies it to minimal effect and capability systems, comparing their ability to classify pure terms. The authors also present a unification combining type, ability, and effect systems, supported by a formal logical relation for reasoning about purity.

Result: Minimal effect and capability systems are shown to be incomparable in expressiveness; neither is strictly more powerful. The proposed unified system provides a framework that combines the strengths and avoids the weaknesses of traditional approaches. Logical relations are introduced to enable rigorous proofs of purity and related properties across systems.

Conclusion: A new semantic foundation and evaluation metric for purity and expressiveness allow better analysis of effect systems and capabilities. The authors' synthesis offers a robust model benefiting from the best aspects of types, abilities, and effects, facilitating practical and precise reasoning about program purity.

Abstract: Programming benefits from a clear separation between pure, mathematical
computation and impure, effectful interaction with the world. Existing
approaches to enforce this separation include monads, type-and-effect systems,
and capability systems. All share a tension between precision and usability,
and each one has non-obvious strengths and weaknesses.
  This paper aims to raise the bar in assessing such systems. First, we propose
a semantic definition of purity, inspired by contextual equivalence, as a
baseline independent of any specific typing discipline. Second, we propose that
expressiveness should be measured by the degree of completeness, i.e., how many
semantically pure terms can be typed as pure. Using this measure, we focus on
minimal meaningful effect and capability systems and show that they are
incomparable, i.e., neither subsumes the other in terms of expressiveness.
  Based on this result, we propose a synthesis and show that type, ability, and
effect systems combine their respective strengths while avoiding their
weaknesses. As part of our formal model, we provide a logical relation to
facilitate proofs of purity and other properties for a variety of effect typing
disciplines.

### [11] [The Functional Machine Calculus III: Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07851)
*Willem Heijltjes*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper extends the Functional Machine Calculus to unify functional and imperative programming, now supporting not only sequential effects but also branching and iteration. It preserves strong theoretical properties (like confluence and termination for non-iterative programs), allowing both paradigms to be modeled in a simple, unified calculus with clear operational semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a longstanding divide between imperative and functional programming paradigms. Existing models generally preserve the strengths of one paradigm while struggling to represent the constructs of the other cleanly. This work seeks to bridge that gap, unifying imperative and functional features in a single, coherent calculus, while maintaining desirable properties like typed termination and confluence.

Method: The paper extends the Functional Machine Calculus, which originally brought together a variety of computational effects and evaluation strategies within an extended lambda-calculus framework. The new work pushes the model further, enlarging its semantic machinery (adding multiple operand stacks, a continuation stack, and operational semantics inspired by the Krivine machine) to faithfully model branching and looping constructs typical of imperative languages.

Result: The new calculus successfully embeds a minimal yet complete imperative language (supporting conditionals, loops, exception handling, constants, and algebraic data types) into the extended framework. It preserves important meta-theoretical properties such as confluent reduction and type-based guarantees of machine termination and strong normalization (except in the presence of iteration).

Conclusion: The extended Functional Machine Calculus offers a unified and operationally intuitive framework that encompasses both functional and imperative paradigms. It supports simple types, a confluent reduction semantics, and faithfully models both sequential and branching/looping effects, paving the way for a more seamless integration of these traditions in programming language theory.

Abstract: The Functional Machine Calculus (Heijltjes 2022) is a new approach to
unifying the imperative and functional programming paradigms. It extends the
lambda-calculus, preserving the key features of confluent reduction and typed
termination, to embed computational effects, evaluation strategies, and control
flow operations. The first instalment modelled sequential higher-order
computation with global store, input/output, probabilities, and
non-determinism, and embedded both the call-by-name and call-by-value
lambda-calculus, as well as Moggi's computational metalanguage and Levy's
call-by-push-value. The present paper extends the calculus from sequential to
branching and looping control flow. This allows the faithful embedding of a
minimal but complete imperative language, including conditionals, exception
handling, and iteration, as well as constants and algebraic data types.
  The calculus is defined through a simple operational semantics, extending the
(simplified) Krivine machine for the lambda-calculus with multiple operand
stacks to model effects and a continuation stack to model sequential,
branching, and looping computation. It features a confluent reduction relation
and a system of simple types that guarantees termination of the machine and
strong normalization of reduction (in the absence of iteration). These
properties carry over to the embedded imperative language, providing a unified
functional-imperative model of computation that supports simple types, a direct
and intuitive operational semantics, and a confluent reduction semantics.
