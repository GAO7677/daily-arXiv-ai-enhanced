The paper has been accepted by\n  SIGCSE 2026", "summary": "While game-based learning is widely used in programming education, few tools\noffer adaptive, real-time support for complex topics, such as C pointers. We\npresent DeliverC, a GenAI-enhanced game that integrates GPT-4-mini to provide\npersonalized hints and generate pointer-related challenges on the fly. In a\npilot study involving 25 undergraduate students, we investigated the impact of\nthe system on learning through gameplay data and a 15-item survey that covered\nconstructs such as motivation, self-efficacy, metacognition, and feedback\nquality. Results show that most students felt more confident and reflective\nafter using the tool, and error rates decreased as students progressed through\nscaffolded levels. However, participation decreased with task difficulty, and\nsome students reported receiving unclear or vague feedback. These findings\nsuggest that DeliverC can enhance engagement and understanding in systems\nprogramming, although refinement in AI-generated feedback is still needed. Our\nstudy highlights the potential of combining GenAI with game-based learning to\nsupport personalized and interactive practice in traditionally challenging\nprogramming domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeliverC, a GenAI-powered game for learning C pointers, boosts student confidence and reduces errors, but faces challenges with feedback clarity and retention at higher difficulty. The study suggests that GenAI plus games can improve programming education, with room for refinement.", "motivation": "Current game-based learning tools lack adaptive, real-time support for difficult programming topics such as C pointers. The motivation is to provide personalized and interactive practice to improve student understanding and confidence.", "method": "The authors developed DeliverC, a GenAI-enhanced game using GPT-4-mini to offer adaptive hints and challenges on C pointers. They conducted a pilot study with 25 undergraduates, collecting gameplay data and analyzing responses to a 15-item survey on motivation, self-efficacy, metacognition, and feedback quality.", "result": "Most students reported increased confidence and reflection after using DeliverC. Error rates dropped as students advanced in the game. However, participation waned with higher difficulty, and some students found AI feedback unclear or vague.", "conclusion": "DeliverC shows promise in enhancing engagement and comprehension in systems programming. Its adaptive features and AI-generated practice support learning, but the feedback mechanism requires improvement for clearer guidance."}}
