SX-Bench introduces a challenging benchmark focused on multi-function, step-wise reasoning tasks. Top models perform worse here than on older benchmarks, revealing limitations and providing a new tool for deeper assessment in code intelligence.", "motivation": "Existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on code intelligence are limited; they mostly measure functional correctness or assess reasoning in simple, single-function contexts. This results in saturated scores for advanced models, making it difficult to distinguish their true capabilities, especially in complex code reasoning.", "method": "The paper introduces STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' understanding of complex multi-function code and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench uses tasks that require cooperation across multiple sub-functions and defines 'computation steps' as the main evaluation unit. Models must predict the number of computation steps, focusing on dynamic execution reasoning. The benchmark generation pipeline uses program synthesis, symbolic execution, and LLM-assisted validation.", "result": "SX-Bench was tested on over 20 mainstream models, including 14 reasoning-focused LLMs. The results show that SX-Bench is much more discriminative: top models like OpenAI-O3 achieved 78.37% accuracy on difficult reasoning tasks\u2014much lower than previous benchmarks where scores are nearly saturated. This demonstrates remaining bottlenecks for code reasoning in current LLMs.", "conclusion": "SX-Bench enables systematic and fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning abilities in complex, multi-function code scenarios. It advances the state of code evaluation and uncovers performance gaps even in leading models, highlighting areas for further improvement."}}
