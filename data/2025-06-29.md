*Lucas Romao,Hugo Villamizar,Romeu Oliveira,Silvio Alonso,Marcos Kalinowski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Agile methods show promise for managing ML-enabled systems, but current literature reveals gaps and challenges, especially in effort estimation. More empirical studies are needed for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning-enabled systems are increasingly prevalent and require project management strategies that can handle rapid changes and experimental cycles. Traditional project management approaches struggle with the unique characteristics of ML development, while agile methods appear promising but lack clear tailoring for ML contexts. This gap motivates analysis of current agile approaches for ML systems.

Method: The authors performed a systematic mapping study, combining database searches with backward and forward snowballing techniques, to gather and analyze relevant literature on agile methods in ML-enabled system development.

Result: The study reviewed 27 papers published between 2008 and 2024, identifying eight frameworks and categorizing recommendations into eight key themes, such as Iteration Flexibility and Minimal Viable Model. Accurate effort estimation for ML tasks emerged as the principal challenge.

Conclusion: The study maps the current state of agile project management for ML-enabled systems and highlights open research gaps. Although progress has been made, further strong empirical evaluation is needed to solidify these agile approaches.

Abstract: [Context] Machine learning (ML)-enabled systems are present in our society,
driving significant digital transformations. The dynamic nature of ML
development, characterized by experimental cycles and rapid changes in data,
poses challenges to traditional project management. Agile methods, with their
flexibility and incremental delivery, seem well-suited to address this
dynamism. However, it is unclear how to effectively apply these methods in the
context of ML-enabled systems, where challenges require tailored approaches.
[Goal] Our goal is to outline the state of the art in agile management for
ML-enabled systems. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study using a
hybrid search strategy that combines database searches with backward and
forward snowballing iterations. [Results] Our study identified 27 papers
published between 2008 and 2024. From these, we identified eight frameworks and
categorized recommendations and practices into eight key themes, such as
Iteration Flexibility, Innovative ML-specific Artifacts, and the Minimal Viable
Model. The main challenge identified across studies was accurate effort
estimation for ML-related tasks. [Conclusion] This study contributes by mapping
the state of the art and identifying open gaps in the field. While relevant
work exists, more robust empirical evaluation is still needed to validate these
contributions.

### [3] [Generating Reliable Adverse event Profiles for Health through Automated Integrated Data (GRAPH-AID): A Semi-Automated Ontology Building Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20851)
*Srikar Reddy Gadusu,Larry Callahan,Samir Lababidi,Arunasri Nishtala,Sophia Healey,Hande McGinty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an accessible, Python-based method to automatically generate OWL ontologies from Neo4j databases, showcased with FDA adverse drug event data, significantly simplifying the process for users and supporting better drug safety analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the rapid expansion of data and knowledge, and frequent content changes, the need for scalable, systematic, and user-friendly methodologies for ontology and knowledge graph generation has become critical, especially for integrating graph databases like Neo4j with ontologies such as OWL.

Method: The paper presents a Python-based approach utilizing the rdflib library to automatically generate ontology classes and their axioms from a Neo4j database. This is demonstrated using data integrated from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

Result: The authors developed a Python script that automates the generation of ontology components from Neo4j data, streamlining the process for users unfamiliar with description logics (DL) syntax. The approach effectively supports the creation of knowledge graphs for rapidly growing pharmaceutical datasets.

Conclusion: This user-friendly Python/rdflib method bridges the gap between Neo4j databases and OWL ontologies, providing a practical, accessible solution for ontology generation, particularly beneficial for drug safety monitoring and public health.

Abstract: As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for
ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data
volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and
retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become
increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address
these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this
methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j
databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate
data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches
often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not
be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to
bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes
Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our
novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically
generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother
integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the
challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse
drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public
health decision-making.

### [4] [Engineering RAG Systems for Real-World Applications: Design, Development, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20869)
*Md Toufique Hasan,Muhammad Waseem,Kai-Kristian Kemell,Ayman Asad Khan,Mika Saari,Pekka Abrahamsson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper develops and evaluates five real-world RAG systems across diverse domains, tests them with 100 users, and presents 12 lessons learned about technical, operational, and ethical issues in practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of empirical studies on real-world RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations that include user involvement and systematic documentation. The motivation is to bridge this gap by developing and evaluating RAG systems in practical scenarios.

Method: The authors developed five domain-specific RAG applications in governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. These systems used multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval with vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, and were deployed via local servers or cloud APIs. They conducted a web-based evaluation with 100 participants, assessing six dimensions of user experience. Additionally, they documented twelve key lessons learned from both feedback and development experience.

Result: The paper presented the development and evaluation results of five RAG-based systems used in real-world domains. Feedback from 100 participants provided evaluations across ease of use, relevance, transparency, responsiveness, accuracy, and likelihood of recommendation. Twelve key lessons were documented regarding technical, operational, and ethical challenges.

Conclusion: Real-world deployment and systematic evaluation of RAG systems reveal significant insights into their reliability and usability, emphasizing the importance of addressing technical, operational, and ethical challenges in practical applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach
for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing
limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a
lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based
implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general
user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons
learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed
for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture,
industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates
multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted
LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs.
A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the
systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii)
Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of
Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we
documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and
ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in
practice.

### [5] [Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20883)
*Kyanna Dagenais,Istvan David*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework that uses reinforcement learning, enhanced by human advice (even if uncertain), to automate and improve the creation of complex model transformation sequences in model-driven engineering. Human-in-the-loop guidance significantly boosts RL efficiency and effectiveness, moving model engineering closer to robust semi-automated solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-driven engineering often requires chaining together complex sequences of model transformations (MTs). Manually designing such sequences is difficult and error-prone. Reinforcement learning (RL) could automate this process but struggles with performance on complex problems. The authors propose that involving uncertain but timely human advice can help overcome these performance issues in RL-driven MT development.

Method: The authors introduce a technical framework that integrates user-defined MTs with RL primitives, allowing these transformations to be executed as RL programs. Their approach enables the RL agent to be guided by human advice, even if the advice is uncertain. The framework evaluates the impact of such human guidance on the RL-driven development of MT sequences.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that incorporating human guidance, even with uncertainty, significantly boosts RL performance. The approach enables more efficient and effective development of complex MTs compared to using RL alone.

Conclusion: The combination of RL and human-in-the-loop advice enhances the automation and quality of developing complex model transformation sequences in model-driven engineering. The method paves the way for RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering processes by balancing the certainty and timeliness of human input.

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations
(MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of
such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design
space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often
infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate
these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial
and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL
methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,
human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach
and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided
by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to
be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal
MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,
substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient
development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and
timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven
human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

### [6] [Boosting Vulnerability Detection with Inter-function Multilateral Association Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21014)
*Shaojian Qiu,Mengyang Huang,Jiahao Cheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces IFMA-VD, a framework that models complex inter-function relationships with hypergraphs to enhance vulnerability detection, showing better performance over existing methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing vulnerability detection methods using deep learning focus only on individual functions and ignore the complex relationships, especially multilateral associations, between different functions. This omission can lead to missed vulnerabilities that occur due to these interrelations.

Method: The authors propose a framework called IFMA-VD that constructs a code behavior hypergraph and uses hyperedge convolution to extract multilateral association features. The process involves parsing functions into a code property graph for intra-function features, building a code behavior hypergraph from a program dependency graph, and applying a hypergraph network to capture multilateral association knowledge for improved vulnerability detection.

Result: IFMA-VD was evaluated on three widely used vulnerability datasets and outperformed baseline methods in terms of F-measure and Recall. The study also shows that incorporating multilateral association features strengthens code feature representation and that IFMA-VD is effective on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Considering multilateral inter-function associations via hypergraph modeling and hyperedge convolutions enhances deep learning-based vulnerability detection methods in their ability to find vulnerabilities, as demonstrated by improved performance metrics and validations on real-world data.

Abstract: Vulnerability detection is a crucial yet challenging technique for ensuring
the security of software systems. Currently, most deep learning-based
vulnerability detection methods focus on stand-alone functions, neglecting the
complex inter-function interrelations, particularly the multilateral
associations. This oversight can fail to detect vulnerabilities in these
interrelations. To address this gap, we present an Inter-Function Multilateral
Association analysis framework for Vulnerability Detection (IFMA-VD). The
cornerstone of the IFMA-VD lies in constructing a code behavior hypergraph and
utilizing hyperedge convolution to extract multilateral association features.
Specifically, we first parse functions into a code property graph to generate
intra-function features. Following this, we construct a code behavior
hypergraph by segmenting the program dependency graph to isolate and encode
behavioral features into hyperedges. Finally, we utilize a hypergraph network
to capture the multilateral association knowledge for augmenting vulnerability
detection. We evaluate IFMA-VD on three widely used vulnerability datasets and
demonstrate improvements in F-measure and Recall compared to baseline methods.
Additionally, we illustrate that multilateral association features can boost
code feature representation and validate the effectiveness of IFMA-VD on
real-world datasets.

### [7] [How Good Are Synthetic Requirements ? Evaluating LLM-Generated Datasets for AI4RE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21138)
*Abdelkarim El-Hajjami,Camille Salinesi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Synthline v1, an improved approach to generating synthetic requirements datasets. By comparing various generation and curation techniques, the authors show that synthetic data, when carefully crafted, can rival or outperform human-written requirements in select AI tasks—helping solve dataset scarcity in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of large, publicly available annotated datasets for requirements engineering, which holds back progress in applying AI to this field. Synthetic data generation via Large Language Models (LLMs) is a promising direction, but methods for controlling and optimizing the quality of generated requirements data have not been fully investigated.

Method: The authors present Synthline v1, a product line-based approach to generate synthetic requirements datasets. They extend their previous work with advanced prompt generation strategies and curation methods. Four experiments are conducted to analyze how prompting techniques, automated prompt optimization (PACE), and post-generation curation affect data quality across four requirements engineering classification tasks.

Result: Multi-sample prompting increases both the usefulness and variety of generated data compared to single-sample approaches, leading to F1-score improvements from 6 to 44 points. Automated prompt optimization (PACE) shows significant gains for some tasks but decreased results for others. Similarity-based data curation improves diversity but can negatively impact model performance, suggesting some redundancy supports machine learning. Notably, synthetic requirements can match or even surpass the performance of human-authored datasets in tasks like security and defect classification.

Conclusion: Systematic synthetic generation of requirements datasets, using advanced LLM prompting and curation, is effective and can potentially overcome the shortage of high-quality data for AI4RE. Synthetic data can, in some cases, outperform real human-authored data, indicating its viability for future research and applications.

Abstract: The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a
major barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering
(AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic
data generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of
generated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,
an enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data
that extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and
curation techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how
prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation
curation affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect
detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security
vs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting
significantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,
with F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic
Editing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,
greatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing
performance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves
diversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some
redundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that
synthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific
tasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and
defect classification (+15.4 points). These findings offer practical insights
for AI4RE and chart a viable path to mitigating dataset scarcity through
systematic synthetic generation.

### [8] [$T^3$: Multi-level Tree-based Automatic Program Repair with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21211)
*Quanming Liu,Xupeng Bu,Zhichao Yan,Ru Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how well reasoning-based AI models work for automated program repair and proposes a new, more effective framework ($T^3$) that improves repair accuracy and efficiency by integrating reasoning and tree search strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is critical in software engineering for reducing manual debugging effort. While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have improved automated reasoning, their applications to APR tasks—requiring complex, multi-step logic—are underexplored.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates existing CoT techniques on APR tasks. It introduces a novel framework, $T^3$, which combines LLMs’ reasoning abilities with tree search methods to enhance the accuracy of candidate repairs. $T^3$ also aids in optimizing sample selection and repair tactics.

Result: The $T^3$ framework leads to more precise generation of repair candidates and offers structured guidance on sample selection and repair strategies, improving the overall efficiency and robustness of automated debugging.

Conclusion: Integrating advanced reasoning techniques from LLMs and tree search in the $T^3$ framework marks a significant step forward for APR, showing performance improvements and providing a strong foundation for future automated debugging solutions.

Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development
and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human
intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the
complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT
techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and
proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning
capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of
generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable
guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks,
establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.

### [9] [KOALA: a Configurable Tool for Collecting IDE Data When Solving Programming Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21266)
*Daniil Karol,Elizaveta Artser,Ilya Vlasov,Yaroslav Golubev,Hieke Keuning,Anastasiia Birillo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: KOALA is a new, configurable plugin for JetBrains IDEs that collects detailed data (code snapshots, IDE actions, feature usage) from students' programming activities, addresses key limitations of previous tools, and provides researchers richer insights into student learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools for collecting student programming data have significant limitations: they lack fine-grained control over what is recorded, miss key events within the programming environment, and are generally difficult to configure. This hinders educators and researchers in fully understanding student activity and learning processes.

Method: The authors introduce KOALA, a configurable data collection plugin for JetBrains IDEs. KOALA can control the granularity of collected code snapshots, logs IDE actions (such as running/debugging), feature usage (like code completion and hotkeys), and even tracks file focus changes. It can distribute programming tasks, control IDE features, and run surveys. Data is stored on a server and can be exported to the standardized ProgSnap2 format.

Result: The KOALA tool was successfully deployed to collect data from 28 students in two programming courses. The data included code snapshots, IDE actions, and additional usage metrics not typically gathered by previous tools, providing valuable new insights into student programming behaviors.

Conclusion: KOALA fills gaps left by previous data collection tools, offering educators and researchers a powerful, flexible way to study how students interact with programming environments. The extra dimensions of data provide new opportunities for analyzing student learning and behavior.

Abstract: Collecting data of students solving programming tasks is incredibly valuable
for researchers and educators. It allows verifying that the students correctly
apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students'
misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g.,
no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the
specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to
configure.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly
configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students
solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in
IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or
disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During
problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured
granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data
not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between
files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where
it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To
showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two
courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.

### [10] [Exploring Micro Frontends: A Case Study Application in E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21297)
*Ricardo Hideki Hangai Kojo,Luiz Fernando Corte Real,Renato Cordeiro Ferreira,Thatiane de Oliveira Rosa,Alfredo Goldman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Micro frontends were successfully implemented to modernize a marketplace's frontend, but similar results could've been achieved with simpler solutions. The main justification was alignment with existing microservices and organizational context, not intrinsic technical necessity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand when adopting the micro frontends architectural style is beneficial, especially within industry settings. The motivation stems from challenges such as system tight coupling, deprecated technologies, and suboptimal developer experiences in an existing marketplace company.

Method: The authors undertook a literature review of both academic and gray sources, implemented micro frontends in an existing microservices-based marketplace, and evaluated the outcome via a semi-open questionnaire given to developers.

Result: The implementation of micro frontends was successful but found not to be strictly necessary; similar outcomes might have been achieved with a monolithic frontend. The choice was ultimately driven by the context: the ongoing shift away from a monolithic architecture (monolith strangulation) and the reuse of microservices infrastructure and team expertise.

Conclusion: While micro frontends added complexity, their adoption was most appropriate due to infrastructure and organizational context, though not strictly required for the business needs. Other architectures could potentially have sufficed.

Abstract: In the micro frontends architectural style, the frontend is divided into
smaller components, which can range from a simple button to an entire page. The
goal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at
the cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks
to understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the
context of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the
state of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray
literature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for
handcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated
the implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At
the studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to
the tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated
frontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor
developer experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture
was adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and
technologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro
Frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's
needs. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other
alternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable
results. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the
company's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,
which facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge
sharing between teams.

### [11] [An object-centric core metamodel for IoT-enhanced event logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21300)
*Yannis Bertrand,Christian Imenkamp,Lukas Malburg,Matthias Ehrendorfer,Marco Franceschetti,Joscha Grüger,Francesco Leotta,Jürgen Mangler,Ronny Seiger,Agnes Koschmider,Stefanie Rinderle-Ma,Barbara Weber,Estefania Serral*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A core data model for integrating IoT and process data is proposed, overcoming current fragmentation and enabling easier data sharing in process mining. A Python prototype validates its effectiveness across use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of integrating IoT data with traditional business process data for process mining. Due to differences in data granularity and fragmented data models, effective data sharing and collaboration are hard to achieve.

Method: The authors synthesize existing data models into a core model that incorporates the most important and common features from current approaches. They develop a prototypical Python implementation to evaluate the model against practical use cases.

Result: The core model successfully supports the integration of IoT and process data, facilitating data sharing and collaboration. The Python prototype demonstrates that the model meets common integration requirements across use cases.

Conclusion: By synthesizing and standardizing the most important features of existing models, the proposed core model overcomes fragmentation. This greatly eases data exchange and collaboration in process mining for IoT-augmented business processes.

Abstract: Advances in Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have prompted the
integration of IoT devices with business processes (BPs) in many organizations
across various sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare and smart spaces. The
proliferation of IoT devices leads to the generation of large amounts of IoT
data providing a window on the physical context of BPs, which facilitates the
discovery of new insights about BPs using process mining (PM) techniques.
However, to achieve these benefits, IoT data need to be combined with
traditional process (event) data, which is challenging due to the very
different characteristics of IoT and process data, for instance in terms of
granularity levels. Recently, several data models were proposed to integrate
IoT data with process data, each focusing on different aspects of data
integration based on different assumptions and requirements. This fragmentation
hampers data exchange and collaboration in the field of PM, e.g., making it
tedious for researchers to share data. In this paper, we present a core model
synthesizing the most important features of existing data models. As the core
model is based on common requirements, it greatly facilitates data sharing and
collaboration in the field. A prototypical Python implementation is used to
evaluate the model against various use cases and demonstrate that it satisfies
these common requirements.
