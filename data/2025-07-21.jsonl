Saad", "Wonyeol Lee"], "title": "Random Variate Generation with Formal Guarantees", "comment": null, "summary": "This article introduces a new approach to principled and practical random\nvariate generation with formal guarantees. The key idea is to first specify the\ndesired probability distribution in terms of a finite-precision numerical\nprogram that defines its cumulative distribution function (CDF), and then\ngenerate exact random variates according to this CDF. We present a universal\nand fully automated method to synthesize exact random variate generators given\nany numerical CDF implemented in any binary number format, such as\nfloating-point, fixed-point, and posits. The method is guaranteed to operate\nwith the same precision used to specify the CDF, does not overflow, avoids\nexpensive arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and exposes a consistent API. The\nmethod rests on a novel space-time optimal implementation for the class of\ngenerators that attain the information-theoretically optimal Knuth and Yao\nentropy rate, consuming the least possible number of input random bits per\noutput variate. We develop a random variate generation library using our method\nin C and evaluate it on a diverse set of ``continuous'' and ``discrete''\ndistributions, showing competitive runtime with the state-of-the-art GNU\nScientific Library while delivering higher accuracy, entropy efficiency, and\nautomation."}

These casts all exhibit a common\nstructural behavior that boils down to the pervasive functoriality of type\nformers. We propose and extensively study a type theory, called AdapTT, which\nmakes systematic and precise this idea of functorial type formers, with respect\nto an abstract notion of adapters relating types. Leveraging descriptions for\nfunctorial inductive types in AdapTT, we derive structural laws for type casts\non general inductive type formers."}

That is, the semantics keep tracks of\nthe usage of resources, and is stuck, besides in case of type errors, if either\na needed resource is exhausted, or a provided resource would be wasted. In such\nway, the type system guarantees, besides standard soundness, that for\nwell-typed programs there is a computation where no resource gets either\nexhausted or wasted.\n  The no-waste extension is parametric on an arbitrary grade algebra, modeling\nan arbitrary assortment of possible usages, and does not require ad-hoc changes\nto the underlying language. To this end, the semantics needs to be formalized\nin big-step style; as a consequence, expressing and proving (resource-aware)\nsoundness is challenging, and is achieved by applying recent techniques based\non coinductive reasoning."}

Despite their instructional relevance, these samples are\noften governed informally, with minimal review and unclear ownership, which\nincreases their exposure to socio-technical degradation. In this context, the\nco-occurrence and longitudinal interplay of code smells (e.g., large classes,\npoor modularity) and community smells (e.g., lone contributors, fragmented\ncommunication) become particularly critical. While each type of smell has been\nstudied in isolation, little is known about how community-level dysfunctions\nanticipate or exacerbate technical anomalies in code samples over time. This\nstudy investigates how code and community smells emerge, co-occur, and evolve\nwithin code samples maintained in OSSECOs. A Multivocal Literature Review\nprotocol was applied, encompassing 30 peer-reviewed papers and 17\npractitioner-oriented sources (2013-2024). Thematic synthesis was conducted to\nidentify recurring socio-technical patterns related to smell dynamics. Nine\npatterns were identified, showing that community smells often precede or\nreinforce technical degradation in code samples. Symptoms such as \"radio\nsilence\" and centralized ownership were frequently associated with persistent\nstructural anomalies. Additionally, limited onboarding, the absence of\ncontinuous refactoring, and informal collaboration emerged as recurring\nconditions for smell accumulation. Conclusion: In OSSECOs, particularly within\ncode samples, community-level dysfunctions not only correlate with but often\nsignal maintainability decay. These findings underscore the need for\nsocio-technical quality indicators and lightweight governance mechanisms\ntailored to shared instructional artifacts."}

Feature requests,\ntypically expressed in natural language, often suffer from ambiguity or\nincomplete information due to communication gaps or the requester's limited\ntechnical expertise. These issues can lead to misinterpretation, faulty\nimplementation, and reduced software quality. While seeking clarification from\nrequesters is a common strategy to mitigate these risks, little is known about\nhow developers engage in this clarification process in practice-how they\nformulate clarifying questions, seek technical or contextual details, align on\ngoals and use cases, or decide to close requests without attempting\nclarification. This study investigates how feature requests are prone to NL\ndefects (i.e. ambiguous or incomplete) and the conversational dynamics of\nclarification in open-source software (OSS) development, aiming to understand\nhow developers handle ambiguous or incomplete feature requests. Our findings\nsuggest that feature requests published on the OSS platforms do possess\nambiguity and incompleteness, and in some cases, both. We also find that\nexplicit clarification for the resolution of these defects is uncommon;\ndevelopers usually focus on aligning with project goals rather than resolving\nunclear text. When clarification occurs, it emphasizes understanding user\nintent/goal and feasibility, rather than technical details. By characterizing\nthe dynamics of clarification in open-source issue trackers, this work\nidentifies patterns that can improve user-developer collaboration and inform\nbest practices for handling feature requests effectively."}

Along with this\ngrowth, fast-paced market changes have led to constantly evolving software\nrequirements. Such requirements are often grounded in feature requests and\nenhancement suggestions, typically provided by users in natural language (NL).\nHowever, these requests often suffer from defects such as ambiguity and\nincompleteness, making them challenging to interpret. Traditional validation\nmethods (e.g., interviews and workshops) help clarify such defects but are\nimpractical in decentralized environments like open-source software (OSS),\nwhere change requests originate from diverse users on platforms like GitHub.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to\ndetect and refine NL defects in feature requests. Our approach automates the\nidentification of ambiguous and incomplete requests and generates clarification\nquestions (CQs) to enhance their usefulness for developers. To evaluate its\neffectiveness, we apply our method to real-world OSS feature requests and\ncompare its performance against human annotations. In addition, we conduct\ninterviews with GitHub developers to gain deeper insights into their\nperceptions of NL defects, the strategies they use to address these defects,\nand the impact of defects on downstream software engineering (SE) tasks."}

This paper attempts to address this problem by exploring two\ncomplementary aspects.\n  First, it proposes a framework for comparing existing test methods in terms\nof their intrinsic effectiveness and validity. It shows that many methods do\nnot meet both of these requirements. Either because they are based on criteria\nthat do not allow for rapid, inexpensive, and comprehensive detection of\nfailures, or because the degree of validity of the properties tested cannot be\naccurately estimated. In particular, it is shown that most critical test\nmethods do not take into account the nominal operational capabilities of\nautopilots and generate scenarios that are impossible for the tested vehicles\nto handle, resulting in unjustified rejections.\n  Secondly, the paper shows that test effectiveness and validity are highly\ndependent on how autopilots are designed: how they choose between different\ncontrol policies to perform maneuvers, as well as on the reproducibility of the\nresults. In fact, most test methods take for granted two principles underlying\ntraditional methods, but do not generally apply to ADS. We maintain that the\nabsence of rationality and determinacy significantly impairs the effectiveness\nand validity of test methods, and provide test results on eight open\nautopilots, in which most do not satisfy these properties, thereby illustrating\nthis fact.\n  We conclude that under the current state of the art, it is impossible to\nobtain strong enough guarantees for essential autopilot properties and\nrecommend that autopilots be developed with a view to both rationality and\ndeterminacy."}
