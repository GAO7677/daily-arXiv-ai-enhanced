driving significant digital transformations. The dynamic nature of ML
development, characterized by experimental cycles and rapid changes in data,
poses challenges to traditional project management. Agile methods, with their
flexibility and incremental delivery, seem well-suited to address this
dynamism. However, it is unclear how to effectively apply these methods in the
context of ML-enabled systems, where challenges require tailored approaches.
[Goal] Our goal is to outline the state of the art in agile management for
ML-enabled systems. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study using a
hybrid search strategy that combines database searches with backward and

published between 2008 and 2024. From these, we identified eight frameworks and
categorized recommendations and practices into eight key themes, such as
Iteration Flexibility, Innovative ML-specific Artifacts, and the Minimal Viable
Model. The main challenge identified across studies was accurate effort
estimation for ML-related tasks. [Conclusion] This study contributes by mapping
the state of the art and identifying open gaps in the field. While relevant
work exists, more robust empirical evaluation is still needed to validate these
contributions.

### [3] [Generating Reliable Adverse event Profiles for Health through Automated Integrated Data (GRAPH-AID): A Semi-Automated Ontology Building Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20851)
*Srikar Reddy Gadusu,Larry Callahan,Samir Lababidi,Arunasri Nishtala,Sophia Healey,Hande McGinty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an accessible Python-based approach for integrating Neo4j graph databases with OWL ontologies, demonstrated using FDA adverse event data, to simplify and streamline ontology creation for improved drug safety monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As data and knowledge continue to grow rapidly, particularly in the biomedical domain, there is a pressing need for systematic methodologies to generate ontologies and knowledge graphs efficiently. The integration between graph databases like Neo4j and standard ontology languages such as OWL is challenging, especially for users unfamiliar with description logics. This complexity necessitates more accessible tools to facilitate ontology development and data integration.

Method: The paper builds upon the Knowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM) and proposes a user-friendly approach using Python and its rdflib library. The authors created a Neo4j database by integrating data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), then developed a Python script to automatically generate ontology classes and axioms from this database.

Result: The approach demonstrated successful integration of data from Neo4j into an OWL ontology, streamlining the process and minimizing the need for specialized knowledge in description logics. The Python script facilitated automatic ontology generation, making the process more accessible for users with limited technical background.

Conclusion: The presented method offers a practical, user-friendly solution for ontology development, particularly suitable for rapidly changing and expanding datasets like adverse drug event records. This enhances ontology generation and supports better drug safety monitoring and public health decision-making.

Abstract: As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for
ontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data
volumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and
retrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become
increasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address
these challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this
methodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j
databases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate
data from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches
often require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not
be familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to
bridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes
Python and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our
novel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
database. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically
generates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother
integration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the
challenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse
drug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public
health decision-making.

### [4] [Engineering RAG Systems for Real-World Applications: Design, Development, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20869)
*Md Toufique Hasan,Muhammad Waseem,Kai-Kristian Kemell,Ayman Asad Khan,Mika Saari,Pekka Abrahamsson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper develops and evaluates five domain-specific RAG systems in practical fields, involving 100 users, and documents twelve major lessons about the real-world technical, operational, and ethical challenges of such deployments, providing comprehensive guidance for future RAG applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are promising for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) by allowing them to ground their outputs in external knowledge, thereby addressing issues with factuality and contextual relevance. However, there is little practical research on real-world applications, user-involved evaluations, and the documentation of practical lessons learned from such deployments.

Method: The authors developed five domain-specific RAG applications for governance, cybersecurity, agriculture, industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system included multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval using vector embeddings, and domain-adapted LLMs, delivered through local servers or cloud APIs. The applications were evaluated by 100 participants through a web-based assessment covering six usability and functionality dimensions. The authors then distilled twelve key lessons learned from their evaluation and development experiences.

Result: The RAG systems were evaluated across ease of use, relevance, transparency, responsiveness, accuracy, and recommendation likelihood by a diverse user base. The assessment led to the identification of twelve critical lessons learned, addressing technical, operational, and ethical issues that impact the effectiveness and user acceptance of RAG-based systems.

Conclusion: RAG-based systems can be successfully implemented in diverse, real-world domains by integrating domain-specific features and adapting to user needs. However, their deployment raises significant technical, operational, and ethical challenges which need to be systematically addressed for broader, reliable adoption. The documented lessons provide valuable guidance for future practitioners and researchers developing similar systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are emerging as a key approach
for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external knowledge, addressing
limitations in factual accuracy and contextual relevance. However, there is a
lack of empirical studies that report on the development of RAG-based
implementations grounded in real-world use cases, evaluated through general
user involvement, and accompanied by systematic documentation of lessons
learned. This paper presents five domain-specific RAG applications developed
for real-world scenarios across governance, cybersecurity, agriculture,
industrial research, and medical diagnostics. Each system incorporates
multilingual OCR, semantic retrieval via vector embeddings, and domain-adapted
LLMs, deployed through local servers or cloud APIs to meet distinct user needs.
A web-based evaluation involving a total of 100 participants assessed the
systems across six dimensions: (i) Ease of Use, (ii) Relevance, (iii)
Transparency, (iv) Responsiveness, (v) Accuracy, and (vi) Likelihood of
Recommendation. Based on user feedback and our development experience, we
documented twelve key lessons learned, highlighting technical, operational, and
ethical challenges affecting the reliability and usability of RAG systems in
practice.

### [5] [Complex Model Transformations by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertain Human Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20883)
*Kyanna Dagenais,Istvan David*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework where reinforcement learning, guided by possibly uncertain human input, is used to efficiently develop complex model transformation sequences in engineering tasks. Their results show that even uncertain human advice helps RL work better and faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-driven engineering often involves chaining together complex model transformations (MTs), which is a difficult, error-prone process if done manually. There is a need for a better approach to efficiently develop and optimize these complex MT sequences.

Method: The paper introduces a framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with the ability to incorporate human guidance—even if the advice is uncertain—while developing sequences of model transformations. The framework maps user-defined MTs to RL primitives, executes them as RL workflows, and optimizes MT sequences through RL, leveraging human input to guide learning.

Result: The evaluation demonstrates that incorporating human guidance significantly boosts the performance of RL in sequencing complex model transformations. Even when the human advice is not fully certain, it still helps RL find optimal or more efficient solutions faster.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables more efficient and reliable development of complex MTs in model-driven engineering by blending RL with human-in-the-loop input. The framework effectively manages trade-offs between the certainty and timeliness of advice, paving the way for advanced human-guided, RL-driven engineering processes.

Abstract: Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations
(MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of
such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design
space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often
infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate
these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial
and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL
methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,
human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach
and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided
by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to
be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal
MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,
substantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient
development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and
timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven
human-in-the-loop engineering methods.

### [6] [Boosting Vulnerability Detection with Inter-function Multilateral Association Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21014)
*Shaojian Qiu,Mengyang Huang,Jiahao Cheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A new hypergraph-based method, IFMA-VD, captures complex inter-function relationships for better vulnerability detection and outperforms previous approaches on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for vulnerability detection mostly focus on stand-alone functions and overlook complex relationships and interactions between functions. This limitation makes it difficult to detect vulnerabilities that are due to these interrelations.

Method: The paper proposes a framework called IFMA-VD, which builds a code behavior hypergraph to model inter-function multilateral associations. Functions are first parsed into code property graphs to get intra-function features. A program dependency graph is segmented to encode behavioral features into hyperedges. A hypergraph network is then used to extract multilateral association features and improve vulnerability detection.

Result: IFMA-VD was tested on three popular vulnerability datasets. The evaluation shows that IFMA-VD achieves better F-measure and Recall compared to existing baseline methods. The framework's use of multilateral association features also leads to improvements in code feature representation. Effectiveness was demonstrated both on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Modeling multilateral inter-function associations using a hypergraph-based approach enhances vulnerability detection. IFMA-VD outperforms existing methods and effectively leverages complex code relationships.

Abstract: Vulnerability detection is a crucial yet challenging technique for ensuring
the security of software systems. Currently, most deep learning-based
vulnerability detection methods focus on stand-alone functions, neglecting the
complex inter-function interrelations, particularly the multilateral
associations. This oversight can fail to detect vulnerabilities in these
interrelations. To address this gap, we present an Inter-Function Multilateral
Association analysis framework for Vulnerability Detection (IFMA-VD). The
cornerstone of the IFMA-VD lies in constructing a code behavior hypergraph and
utilizing hyperedge convolution to extract multilateral association features.
Specifically, we first parse functions into a code property graph to generate
intra-function features. Following this, we construct a code behavior
hypergraph by segmenting the program dependency graph to isolate and encode
behavioral features into hyperedges. Finally, we utilize a hypergraph network
to capture the multilateral association knowledge for augmenting vulnerability
detection. We evaluate IFMA-VD on three widely used vulnerability datasets and
demonstrate improvements in F-measure and Recall compared to baseline methods.
Additionally, we illustrate that multilateral association features can boost
code feature representation and validate the effectiveness of IFMA-VD on
real-world datasets.

### [7] [How Good Are Synthetic Requirements ? Evaluating LLM-Generated Datasets for AI4RE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21138)
*Abdelkarim El-Hajjami,Camille Salinesi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Synthline v1 systematically improves synthetic requirements data generation for AI in Requirements Engineering, often matching or outperforming human data in key classification tasks, offering a practical approach to overcome data scarcity in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets, which impedes progress in applying AI to Requirements Engineering (AI4RE). Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate synthetic data, there is limited understanding of how to systematically improve the quality of such generated requirements.

Method: The authors present Synthline v1, an improved Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data, which builds on their earlier version. They use advanced generation strategies and curation techniques, and systematically examine how different prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization (PACE), and post-generation curation affect data quality. The evaluation covers four classification tasks: defect detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security vs. non-security.

Result: Multi-sample prompting raises utility and diversity, with significant F1-score improvements. PACE improves performance for functional classification but can decrease it for other tasks. Similarity-based curation boosts diversity but may lower classification scores, suggesting that redundancy in data can benefit machine learning models. In some cases, synthetic data generated by their method outperforms human-authored data, notably in security and defect classification.

Conclusion: Systematic synthetic generation using advanced strategies, automated optimization, and thoughtful curation can produce high-quality requirements data, sometimes even surpassing human-authored examples in specific tasks. These methods offer a practical solution to the shortage of labeled requirements datasets in AI4RE.

Abstract: The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a
major barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering
(AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic
data generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of
generated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,
an enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data
that extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and
curation techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how
prompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation
curation affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect
detection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security
vs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting
significantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,
with F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic
Editing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,
greatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing
performance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves
diversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some
redundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that
synthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific
tasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and
defect classification (+15.4 points). These findings offer practical insights
for AI4RE and chart a viable path to mitigating dataset scarcity through
systematic synthetic generation.

### [8] [$T^3$: Multi-level Tree-based Automatic Program Repair with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21211)
*Quanming Liu,Xupeng Bu,Zhichao Yan,Ru Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Chain-of-Thought methods for program repair and introduces $T^3$, a framework that uses LLMs and tree search to achieve better automatic software debugging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic Program Repair (APR) aims to automatically fix software defects with minimal human input. While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have enhanced software reasoning tasks, their potential in APR remains underexplored due to the domain's complex reasoning requirements.

Method: The study evaluates several CoT techniques on APR tasks to understand their effectiveness. Then, it introduces a new framework called $T^3$, which integrates LLMs with a tree search strategy to improve the precision of candidate repair generation and guides optimal sample selection and repair.

Result: $T^3$ substantially improves the accuracy of generating repair solutions for APR compared to baseline CoT approaches. The framework also aids in optimizing strategies for automated debugging tasks.

Conclusion: By combining the reasoning strengths of LLMs with tree search through the $T^3$ framework, the study achieves more reliable and efficient program repair, laying the groundwork for improved automated debugging.

Abstract: Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development
and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human
intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the
complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT
techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and
proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning
capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of
generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable
guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks,
establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.

### [9] [KOALA: a Configurable Tool for Collecting IDE Data When Solving Programming Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21266)
*Daniil Karol,Elizaveta Artser,Ilya Vlasov,Yaroslav Golubev,Hieke Keuning,Anastasiia Birillo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: KOALA is a versatile JetBrains IDE plugin that enables researchers to collect highly configurable and detailed data on student programming, addressing the limitations of past tools and providing new insights through real classroom use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers and educators need detailed and configurable tools to collect data on how students solve programming tasks. Existing tools lack control over data granularity, do not capture all relevant IDE events, and are difficult to configure.

Method: The authors developed KOALA, a plugin for JetBrains IDEs that collects code snapshots, tracks IDE feature usage, and captures additional events like hotkey use and file switching. The plugin can be configured for specific data granularity, tasks, and settings. Data is stored centrally and can be exported in a standard format (ProgSnap2).

Result: KOALA was deployed in two real university courses with 28 students. It successfully collected rich, granular data, including types of IDE interactions not available in previous tools, enabling new insights into student programming behavior.

Conclusion: KOALA offers an advanced, configurable way to collect detailed programming behavior data from students in realistic settings, overcoming previous tool limitations and supporting new research possibilities.

Abstract: Collecting data of students solving programming tasks is incredibly valuable
for researchers and educators. It allows verifying that the students correctly
apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students'
misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g.,
no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the
specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to
configure.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly
configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students
solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in
IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or
disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During
problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured
granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data
not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between
files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where
it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To
showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two
courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.

### [10] [Exploring Micro Frontends: A Case Study Application in E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21297)
*Ricardo Hideki Hangai Kojo,Luiz Fernando Corte Real,Renato Cordeiro Ferreira,Thatiane de Oliveira Rosa,Alfredo Goldman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates when micro frontends are worth adopting in industry by reviewing literature, implementing the architecture in a real company, and surveying developers. While micro frontends worked well, alternative architectures could have sufficed. The deciding factors were existing microservices and the need to decouple from a monolith, making micro frontends most suitable for this specific context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to evaluate when it is worthwhile to adopt micro frontends architecture in industry, especially in cases where legacy systems, outdated technology, and developer experience challenges exist.

Method: The authors conducted a review of both academic and gray literature on micro frontends. They then implemented a micro frontends architecture in an existing marketplace for handcrafted products (with pre-existing microservices), and evaluated the process and outcomes using a semi-open questionnaire answered by developers.

Result: The implementation of micro frontends was successful in the marketplace company, but other alternatives (like a monolithic frontend) could have achieved similar outcomes. The main value in adopting micro frontends lay in the company's context: the need to gradually decouple from a monolithic architecture (monolith strangulation) and their existing microservices infrastructure, which made the transition smoother and knowledge sharing easier.

Conclusion: Adopting micro frontends is not strictly necessary for all organizations facing similar issues; in some cases, monolithic frontends can produce comparable results. However, micro frontends are particularly convenient when there are existing microservices, infrastructure to reuse, and a need to gradually move away from a monolithic system. The decision to use micro frontends should thus depend on the particular organization context rather than general assumptions about the architecture's superiority.

Abstract: In the micro frontends architectural style, the frontend is divided into
smaller components, which can range from a simple button to an entire page. The
goal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at
the cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks
to understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the
context of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the
state of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray
literature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for
handcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated
the implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At
the studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to
the tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated
frontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor
developer experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture
was adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and
technologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro
Frontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's
needs. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other
alternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable
results. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the
company's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,
which facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge
sharing between teams.

### [11] [An object-centric core metamodel for IoT-enhanced event logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21300)
*Yannis Bertrand,Christian Imenkamp,Lukas Malburg,Matthias Ehrendorfer,Marco Franceschetti,Joscha Grüger,Francesco Leotta,Jürgen Mangler,Ronny Seiger,Agnes Koschmider,Stefanie Rinderle-Ma,Barbara Weber,Estefania Serral*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A new core data model integrates IoT and process data for process mining, improving data sharing and collaboration. Its effectiveness is shown by a prototype Python implementation and testing in various use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of IoT in various industries generates vast amounts of IoT data, which—when combined with traditional business process (event) data—can provide valuable insights via process mining techniques. However, significant challenges arise due to the differing characteristics and granularity of IoT and process data. Existing data integration models are fragmented, causing issues in data exchange and collaboration for process mining research.

Method: The authors propose a core data model that synthesizes the most important features of existing data models. The design of this model addresses common requirements for effective integration of IoT and process data. They provide a prototypical Python implementation to evaluate the model against diverse use cases.

Result: The core model facilitates integration of heterogeneous IoT and process data, easing data sharing and enhancing collaboration in the process mining research community. The Python implementation demonstrates that the model meets common requirements through evaluation in various scenarios.

Conclusion: By providing a unified core data model grounded in common requirements of IoT and process integration, the paper advances data sharing and collaboration in process mining. The model overcomes the limitations of fragmented existing approaches and is validated through prototypical implementation and use case evaluation.

Abstract: Advances in Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have prompted the
integration of IoT devices with business processes (BPs) in many organizations
across various sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare and smart spaces. The
proliferation of IoT devices leads to the generation of large amounts of IoT
data providing a window on the physical context of BPs, which facilitates the
discovery of new insights about BPs using process mining (PM) techniques.
However, to achieve these benefits, IoT data need to be combined with
traditional process (event) data, which is challenging due to the very
different characteristics of IoT and process data, for instance in terms of
granularity levels. Recently, several data models were proposed to integrate
IoT data with process data, each focusing on different aspects of data
integration based on different assumptions and requirements. This fragmentation
hampers data exchange and collaboration in the field of PM, e.g., making it
tedious for researchers to share data. In this paper, we present a core model
synthesizing the most important features of existing data models. As the core
model is based on common requirements, it greatly facilitates data sharing and
collaboration in the field. A prototypical Python implementation is used to
evaluate the model against various use cases and demonstrate that it satisfies
these common requirements.
